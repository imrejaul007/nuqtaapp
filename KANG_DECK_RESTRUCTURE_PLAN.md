## DETAILED SLIDE BREAKDOWN

### SLIDE 1: COVER (15 SECONDS)
**Purpose:** Hook + Context

**Visual:**
```
[Nuqta Logo - Large]

"The Smart Shopping Super-App for UAE"

Discover. Pay Smart. Earn Double.

[Bottom line]

🛍️ Shops at 10 stores/month
💳 Uses 3 different credit cards
📱 Checks 5 cashback apps
❌ Misses 60% of savings opportunities
💸 Loses AED 150/month in unclaimed rewards

[Right side: The market pain]
📊 UAE shoppers waste AED 2.4B annually
   in missed cashback & rewards

Why?
1. Too many apps (fragmentation)

```

**Key metric:** AED 2.4B wasted annually
