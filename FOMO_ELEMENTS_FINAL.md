## 💡 Alternative Ways to Create Urgency (Without Lying)

If you want to add more urgency later WHEN IT'S TRUE:

### When You Have Real Commitments:
```
"$XXK committed from Y investors"
(Only add when actually true)
```

### When You Set a Real Deadline:
```
"Round closes [actual date]"
(Only when you have a genuine deadline)
```

### When You Establish Benefits:
```
"Early investors receive [actual confirmed benefits]"
(Only when legally confirmed with counsel)
```

### When Merchants Are Actually Onboarding:
```
"X merchants actively onboarding this week"
(Only when factually accurate)
```
