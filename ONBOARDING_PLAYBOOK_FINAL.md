## 1.5 The Merchant Pitch (30 Seconds)

### Opening (5 sec):
> "Hi, I'm [Name] from Nuqta. We bring you new customers for free."

### Problem (5 sec):
> "You're spending AED 50-100 per customer on Instagram ads with zero guarantee."

### Solution (10 sec):
> "With Nuqta, customers scan a QR at your counter, get cashback, and keep coming back. You pay nothing upfront. Only 15-20% when they redeem."

### Close (10 sec):
> "It's zero risk. Can I show you a 2-minute demo on my phone?"

---

## 1.6 Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "15-20% is too high" | "You pay AED 50-100 for ONE customer on Instagram. 15% of AED 50 = AED 7.50. Which is cheaper?" |
| "I already have loyal customers" | "Great! They'll earn coins here and bring friends. Your loyal customers become your marketers." |
| "What if no one uses it?" | "You pay ZERO until they do. No transactions = no cost." |
| "How is this different from Entertainer?" | "Entertainer is 50% discount + subscription. We're cashback, not discount. You don't devalue your brand." |
| "I need to think about it" | "Totally understand. Can I WhatsApp you the one-pager? I'll follow up Thursday." |
