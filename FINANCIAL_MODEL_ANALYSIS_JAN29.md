**ReZ 2026 (8).xlsx - Full Audit & Comparison to Pitch Deck**

---

## ⚠️ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: MAJOR DISCREPANCIES FOUND

**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL INCONSISTENCIES** between this Excel model and your pitch deck

**Verdict:** ❌ **DO NOT USE THIS MODEL FOR INVESTORS** - Contains data that contradicts your pitch deck and Master Roadmap

---

## 🔴 TOP 10 CRITICAL ISSUES

### **1. WRONG CURRENCY (INR vs AED)** 🚨

**Excel Model:** Uses **INR (Indian Rupees)** throughout
- Row 3 (Income Statement): "( values in ₹)"
- All revenue projections in INR
- CAC assumptions in INR

**Pitch Deck:** Uses **AED (UAE Dirhams)** throughout
- CAC: AED 30-40
- LTV: AED 360
- Monthly RPU: AED 30
- GMV: AED 10M

**Issue:** This is a **UAE-based company (Dubai focus)**, not India. Using INR is fundamentally wrong.

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Entire model is in wrong currency (1 AED ≈ 22-23 INR, so numbers are ~20x off)

---

### **2. WRONG AVERAGE ORDER VALUE (AOV)** 🚨

**Excel Model:** AOV = **INR 650** (~AED 28)
- Row 3 (Income Statement): "AOV | 650.00"

**Pitch Deck:** AOV = **AED 100**
- Unit Economics slide clearly shows AED 100 avg transaction

**Issue:** Model uses INR 650 (≈AED 28), but pitch deck models AED 100 transactions

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - All GMV calculations will be 3.5x lower than pitch deck

---

### **3. WRONG USER ACQUISITION NUMBERS (H1)** 🚨

**Excel Model (Month 6 - End of Phase 1):**
- Total Active Users: **9,633** MAU
- Total Downloads: **33,802**

**Pitch Deck H1 Target (Month 5):**
- Target: **10,000 MAU**
- Gate criteria: Must hit 10K MAU to pass H1

**Issue:** Model shows only 9,633 MAU at Month 6 vs pitch deck's 10K target at Month 5

**Impact:** 🟡 **MODERATE** - Close enough, but timeline mismatch (6 months vs 5 months)

---

### **4. WRONG MERCHANT ACQUISITION NUMBERS** 🚨

**Excel Model (Month 6):**
- New Business on App (Month 1): **158 merchants**
- Active Business Users (Month 6): **1,673 merchants**

**Pitch Deck H1 Target:**
- Month 1-2: **10-20 merchants**
- H1 Gate: **250 merchants**

**Issue:** Model shows 1,673 merchants vs pitch deck's 250 merchant target

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Excel model is **6.7x higher** than pitch deck (unrealistic)

---

### **5. WRONG REVENUE MODEL** 🚨

**Excel Model Revenue Sources:**
1. Commission on Sales (Year 1: INR 42.6M)
2. Promoted Sales 5% (Year 1: INR 17M)
3. **Business Subscription** (Year 1: INR 25.3M) ← ❌ **NOT IN PITCH DECK**
4. Affiliate (Year 1: INR 2.6M)
5. User Subscription (Year 1: INR 12.8M) ← ❌ **NOT IN PITCH DECK**
6. Finance revenue
7. B2B Buying revenue

**Pitch Deck Revenue Model:**
1. **Merchant Fee:** 15% of transaction (only revenue source in H1)
2. User cashback: 7% (cost, not revenue)
3. Net take rate: 7.5%

**Issue:** Excel has 7 revenue streams; pitch deck has 1 (merchant fee)

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Pitch deck says "merchant-funded cashback, zero subsidy" but Excel shows user subscriptions, B2B buying, finance revenue (none of these exist in pitch deck)

---

### **6. WRONG CAC ASSUMPTIONS** 🚨

**Excel Model CAC (Customer Acquisition sheet):**
- Meta/Google ads: **INR 300 CAC** (≈AED 13)
- College Business Fest: **INR 66.67 CAC** (≈AED 3)
- College Sports Fest: **INR 100 CAC** (≈AED 4.3)
- Merchant QR boards: **INR 50 CAC** (≈AED 2.2)

**Pitch Deck CAC:**
- Merchant QR: **AED 10-15**
- Student Ambassadors: **AED 25-30**
- Digital (later): **AED 60-80**
- Blended: **AED 30-40**

**Issue:** Excel CAC is way too low (AED 2-13 vs pitch deck AED 30-40)

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Model assumes unrealistic CAC (AED 3 for college fest? AED 2 for QR? Too optimistic)

---

### **7. WRONG PHASE 1 FUNDING** 🚨

**Excel Model (Assumptions sheet):**
- Phase 1 Cash: **INR 5,000,000** (≈AED 217K)
- Phase 2 Funding: **INR 500,000** (≈AED 21.7K)
- Total Investment: **INR 5,000,000**

**Pitch Deck:**
- Raising: **$300K via SAFE** (≈AED 1.1M, ≈INR 25M)
- 20% discount, no cap

**Issue:** Excel shows INR 5M (AED 217K) vs pitch deck $300K (INR 25M)

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Model is underfunded by **5x** compared to pitch deck

---

### **8. WRONG BURN RATE ALLOCATION** 🚨

**Excel Model (Phase 1 - 6 months, Monthly):**
- Rent & Office: INR 66,667/mo (8%)
- Team & Legal: INR 66,667/mo (8%)
- Customer Support: INR 66,667/mo (8%)
- Technology: INR 166,667/mo (20%)
- Business Dev: INR 158,333/mo (19%)
- Marketing: INR 300,000/mo (36%)
- **Total Monthly Burn: INR 833,333** (≈AED 36K)

**Pitch Deck (Implied from $300K / 8-10 months):**
- Total Monthly Burn: **$30-37.5K/month** (≈AED 110-138K/month, ≈INR 2.5-3M/month)

**Issue:** Excel shows INR 833K/mo burn, but $300K for 8-10 months = INR 2.5-3M/mo

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Model burn is **3x lower** than pitch deck (INR 833K vs INR 2.5M)

---

### **9. WRONG REVENUE PROJECTIONS (YEAR 1)** 🚨

**Excel Model (Year 1 Total Revenue):**
- **INR 100,380,194** (≈AED 4.36M, ≈$1.2M)
- Breakdown:
  - Commission: INR 42.6M
  - Promoted Sales: INR 17M
  - Business Subscription: INR 25.3M
  - Affiliate: INR 2.6M
  - User Subscription: INR 12.8M

**Pitch Deck (H1 - 5 months):**
- GMV Target: **AED 10M cumulative**
- Revenue (7.5% net take rate): **AED 750K**
- Annualized (Year 1): ~**AED 1.5-2M** (if extrapolated)

**Issue:** Excel shows INR 100M (AED 4.36M) vs pitch deck AED 1.5-2M

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Excel is **2-3x higher** than pitch deck (overly optimistic)

---

### **10. WRONG MERCHANT COUNT GROWTH RATE** 🚨

**Excel Model:**
- Month 1: 158 new merchants
- Month 2: 158 new merchants
- Month 3: 449 new merchants (2.83x jump)
- Month 4: 406 new merchants
- Month 5: 338 new merchants
- Month 6: 350 new merchants
- **Total by Month 6: 1,673 active merchants**

**Pitch Deck:**
- Month 1-2: 10-20 merchants
- Month 3-4: 100 merchants
- **H1 Target (Month 5): 250 merchants**

**Issue:** Excel assumes 158 merchants in Month 1 (vs 10-20 in deck), ends at 1,673 (vs 250 target)

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Excel is **6.7x higher** on merchant count (unrealistic for H1)

## 🎯 MY POINT OF VIEW: THIS MODEL IS UNUSABLE

### **1. FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES:**

❌ **Wrong Geography:** Model is for India (INR), but Nuqta is UAE-focused (AED)
❌ **Wrong Business Model:** Model has 7 revenue streams; pitch deck has 1 (merchant fee)
❌ **Wrong Unit Economics:** AOV, CAC, LTV all misaligned with pitch deck
❌ **Wrong Funding:** Shows INR 5M (AED 217K) vs $300K raise (AED 1.1M)
❌ **Wrong Merchant Count:** 1,673 merchants vs 250 target (6.7x off)

### **2. WHY THIS MODEL EXISTS (MY HYPOTHESIS):**

This looks like a **generic startup financial template** that was:
- Built for an **Indian market** (hence INR)
- Created by a **fractional CFO or consultant** (note: "Startup" + "Minor Financial Projections for a pitch")
- **Not customized** for Nuqta's specific business model
- Possibly created **before you finalized the pitch deck** (hence discrepancies)

**Evidence:**
- "Provided by client" vs "Assumed" vs "Calculated" color coding (lines 5-7)
- Generic revenue streams (B2B buying, finance, subscriptions) not in your model
- "ReZ" branding (is this an old name or different product?)
- INR currency (India focus, not UAE)

### **3. WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WITH THIS MODEL?**

🚨 **DO NOT SEND THIS TO INVESTORS** - It contradicts your pitch deck and will raise red flags

**Options:**

**A. Rebuild Model from Scratch (Recommended)** ✅
- Start with **pitch deck unit economics** as source of truth
- Use **AED currency** (not INR)
- Use **AED 100 AOV** (not INR 650)
- Use **250 merchant target** for H1 (not 1,673)
- Use **AED 30-40 CAC** (not INR 50)
- Use **$300K raise = AED 1.1M** (not INR 5M)
- Model **1 revenue stream** in H1 (merchant fee 7.5% net take rate)
- Use **5-month H1 timeline** (not 6 months)

**B. Fix This Model (Not Recommended)** ⚠️
- Would require changing every single assumption
- Currency conversion alone would break all formulas
- Easier to start fresh with correct assumptions

**C. Use for Internal Learning Only** 📚
- Treat as a **directional template** for structure
- Use the **sheet layout** (Dashboard, Monthly Breakdown, Income Statement, Assumptions, CAC, Charts)
- But **replace all numbers** with pitch deck data

### **4. SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED (IF YOU WANT TO SALVAGE IT):**

**CRITICAL FIXES:**
1. ✅ Change currency: INR → AED (or USD)
2. ✅ Change AOV: INR 650 → AED 100
3. ✅ Change CAC: INR 50-300 → AED 30-40
4. ✅ Change merchant target: 1,673 → 250 (Month 5)
5. ✅ Change user target: 9,633 (Month 6) → 10,000 (Month 5)
6. ✅ Change funding: INR 5M → $300K (AED 1.1M)
7. ✅ Change burn rate: INR 833K/mo → AED 110-138K/mo
8. ✅ Remove revenue streams: Delete Business Subscription, User Subscription, B2B Buying, Finance
9. ✅ Keep only merchant fee revenue (15% gross, 7.5% net)
10. ✅ Change timeline: 6 months Phase 1 → 5 months H1

**MODERATE FIXES:**
11. ✅ Align growth rates with Master Roadmap
12. ✅ Add H1 gate criteria (10K MAU, 250 merchants, AED 10M GMV)
13. ✅ Add H2/H3 phasing (not just Year 1/2/3)
14. ✅ Add category breakdown (F&B, Beauty, Fashion, Fitness)
15. ✅ Add retention assumptions (D7, D30, M6, M12)

## 🚀 WHAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED: PITCH DECK-ALIGNED MODEL

Here's what a **correct financial model** should show (aligned with your pitch deck):

### **H1 (Month 1-5) Targets:**

| **Metric** | **Month 1** | **Month 3** | **Month 5 (Gate)** |
|------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **MAU** | 1,000 | 5,000 | 10,000 |
| **Merchants** | 10-20 | 100 | 250 |
| **GMV (cumulative)** | AED 500K | AED 5M | AED 10M |
| **Revenue (7.5% net)** | AED 37.5K | AED 375K | AED 750K |
| **CAC (blended)** | AED 30-40 | AED 30-40 | AED 30-40 |
| **Monthly Burn** | AED 110-138K | AED 110-138K | AED 110-138K |

### **Revenue Model (H1):**
- **Only 1 stream:** Merchant fee (15% gross - 7% cashback = 7.5% net)
- **GMV = MAU × Avg transaction (AED 100) × Frequency (4x/month)**
- Example: 10K MAU × AED 100 × 4 trans/month × 7.5% = **AED 300K/month** revenue at Month 5

### **Cost Structure (H1 - $300K / 8 months):**
- **Monthly Burn:** $37.5K (≈AED 138K)
- Marketing (60%): AED 82.8K
- Tech (20%): AED 27.6K
- Operations (20%): AED 27.6K

## 🎯 FINAL VERDICT

### **Excel Model Status:** ❌ **REJECT - DO NOT USE**

**Why:**
1. Wrong currency (INR not AED)
2. Wrong business model (7 revenue streams vs 1)
3. Wrong unit economics (AOV, CAC, LTV all misaligned)
4. Wrong targets (6.7x more merchants than pitch deck)
5. Wrong funding (5x less than $300K raise)
6. Wrong burn rate (3x lower than realistic)

### **My Recommendation:**

✅ **BUILD A NEW MODEL** from scratch using:
- **Source of truth:** Your pitch deck + Master Roadmap
- **Currency:** AED (or USD)
- **Timeline:** H1 (5 mo), H2 (2.5 mo), H3 (12 mo), Y2-Y4
- **Revenue:** 1 stream (merchant fee 7.5% net) in H1
- **Targets:** 10K MAU, 250 merchants, AED 10M GMV (H1 gate)
- **CAC:** AED 30-40 blended
- **Burn:** $300K over 8-10 months = $30-37.5K/month

### **Use This Excel File For:**
📚 **Structure inspiration only** (sheet layout, chart ideas)
❌ **NOT for numbers, assumptions, or investor presentations**

### **Don't Use This Excel File For:**
❌ Investor presentations
❌ Fundraising conversations
❌ Board updates
❌ Financial projections in pitch deck

---

## 💡 NEXT STEPS

### **Immediate (Today):**
1. ✅ **Archive this Excel model** - rename to "ReZ_2026_OLD_DO_NOT_USE.xlsx"
2. ✅ **Do NOT send to investors** - it will contradict your pitch deck

### **Short-Term (This Week):**
1. ⏳ **Build new model** using pitch deck as source of truth
2. ⏳ Use Master Roadmap for H1/H2/H3 phasing
3. ⏳ Model only merchant fee revenue (7.5% net) for H1
4. ⏳ Use AED 100 AOV, AED 30-40 CAC, 10K MAU target

### **Long-Term (Optional):**
1. ⏳ Add H2/H3 revenue streams (Healthcare, Home Services categories)
2. ⏳ Add float revenue (post-SVF license, Year 2)
3. ⏳ Add wallet interest income (4-5% yield on AED 2.5M float)
4. ⏳ Add sensitivity analysis (retention 6mo/8mo/12mo, fraud 2%/3%/5%)

## 🚨 WARNING TO INVESTORS

If you send this Excel model to investors, here's what will happen:

❌ **Investor:** "Your deck says AED 30 CAC, but your model shows INR 50 (AED 2)?"
❌ **Investor:** "Your deck says 250 merchants, but your model shows 1,673?"
❌ **Investor:** "Your deck says you're raising $300K, but your model shows INR 5M (AED 217K)?"
❌ **Investor:** "Your deck says merchant-funded cashback (zero subsidy), but your model has user subscriptions?"
❌ **Investor:** "Your deck is in AED (UAE), but your model is in INR (India) - which market are you in?"

**Result:** 🔴 **Loss of credibility. Deal killed.**
