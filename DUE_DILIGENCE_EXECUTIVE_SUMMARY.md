# DUE DILIGENCE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
## Nuqta - $400K Pre-Seed Investment

**Date:** January 30, 2026
**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL PASS**

---

## ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT

**Nuqta is a high-risk, differentiated UAE fintech play with 95-140x return potential, but solo founder status and pre-product stage require mandatory co-founder hire and milestone-based funding.**

---

## INVESTMENT SCORECARD

| Category | Grade | Comments |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Market Opportunity** | A- | $35B GCC SAM validated, real AED 2.4B problem |
| **Product Differentiation** | A | POS system + habit loops = strong moats |
| **Unit Economics** | B+ | 10x LTV:CAC credible, but CAC will rise Year 2 |
| **Financial Model** | B- | Recently corrected (-63%), now realistic |
| **Team** | C | ⚠️ Solo founder = deal-breaker risk |
| **Traction** | C+ | 30 LOIs positive, but no live product |
| **Competitive Position** | B | 12-18 month window before Careem copies |
| **Regulatory Path** | B- | SVF license complex, costs underestimated |
| **Go-to-Market** | B+ | Evidence-based, but slow ramp (6-9 months) |
| **Terms** | B+ | Fair at $5M cap, prefer $4M for pre-product |

**Overall Grade:** **B-** (Investable with conditions)

## THE GOOD ✅

### 1. Real, Large Market
- $35B GCC offline retail opportunity
- AED 2.4B wasted annually on broken loyalty programs
- 95% of offline spending gets zero rewards
- Problem validated by McKinsey, Euromonitor data

### 2. Differentiated Moats
**Not just another cashback app:**
- **POS/Inventory System:** Merchant lock-in (high switching cost)
- **Daily Habit Loops:** Engagement moat (8+ opens/month target)
- **Event Infrastructure:** Offline community (concerts, festivals)
- **Dual Coin System:** Nuqta Coin (universal) + Brand Coin (loyalty)

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Careem Rewards: No merchant POS, passive engagement
- Tabby: No discovery layer, pure payments
- Spotpay/Yalla: Pure cashback, no moats

### 3. Credible Unit Economics
- **LTV:CAC = 10x** (validated against benchmarks)
- LTV: AED 540 ($147) over 18 months
- CAC: AED 50 ($13.60) blended
- Still healthy at 6-8x if CAC rises to AED 80

### 4. Evidence-Based GTM
- 3 proven channels (Merchant QR, Student Ambassadors, Habit Loops)
- Benchmarked CAC: AED 40-45 Year 1 (realistic)
- Comparable to Spotpay (AED 12 QR CAC), Careem (AED 25-30)

### 5. Honest Founder
- **Corrected financials proactively** (-63% revision)
- Shows intellectual honesty and learning ability
- Strategic frameworks demonstrate sophistication

---

## THE BAD ❌

### 1. Solo Founder (CRITICAL)
- **65% higher failure rate** vs co-founder teams
- No CTO, no Head of Product, no VP Growth
- **This alone is near deal-breaker territory**
- **Must hire co-founder within 90 days of funding**

### 2. Pre-Revenue, Pre-Product
- Q1 2026 launch commitment (2-3 months away)
- No MVP demonstrated yet
- 30 LOIs ≠ live merchant integrations (40-60% activation rate typical)
- Extreme early-stage risk

### 3. Financial Model Revised -63%
**Original → Corrected:**
- Year 5 Revenue: $319M → $118.5M (-63%)
- Exit Valuation: $2.5-3.8B → $950M-1.4B (-63%)
- Investor Return: 332-505x → 95-140x (-71%)

**Cause:**
- Overstated transaction frequency (6x → 3-5x)
- Missing $2.5M in costs (fraud, support, compliance)
- Optimistic CAC (AED 30 → AED 50)

**Impact:** Shows financial modeling inexperience

### 4. Regulatory Costs Underestimated
- **SVF License Required:** For float interest revenue (10% of model)
  - Cost: AED 50-70K + legal
  - Capital: AED 5M minimum paid-up
  - Timeline: 12-18 months approval
  - **Not budgeted in $400K pre-seed**

### 5. Competitive Threats (12-18 Month Window)
- **Careem Rewards** (3M users): Could add POS integrations
- **Noon** (10M users): Could bundle loyalty with e-commerce
- **Tabby** ($700M valuation): Could add discovery layer

**First-mover advantage expires in 12-18 months**

### 6. Tight Runway
- $400K = 12 months exactly
- No buffer for delays or higher CAC
- Must raise Series A by Month 10-11 or die
- If fundraising market freezes → fatal

## THE UGLY ⚠️

### Risk Matrix (Top 5)

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Score |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Solo founder quits/burnout | Fatal | 30% | **9/10** |
| Careem copies model | High | 60% | **9/10** |
| Failed Series A raise | Fatal | 35% | **8/10** |
| SVF license delayed/denied | High | 25% | **7/10** |
| Merchant churn >20% | High | 30% | **7/10** |

**Overall Risk Profile:** **HIGH** (even for pre-seed)

---

## RETURN ANALYSIS

### Base Case (35% Probability)
- Year 5: $118.5M revenue
- Exit: $1.2B (10x revenue multiple)
- Investor ownership: 4% (post-dilution)
- Exit value: **$48M**
- Return: **120x on $400K**

### Sensitivity Analysis

| Scenario | Exit Valuation | Return | Probability |
|----------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Conservative | $950M | 95x ($38M) | 15% |
| Base Case | $1.2B | 120x ($48M) | 35% |
| Optimistic | $1.4B | 140x ($56M) | 10% |
| **Failure** | **$0** | **0x** | **40%** |

**Expected Value:** ~$25M (62x blended)

### Downside Protection

**What if projections miss by 50%?**
- Year 5 Revenue: $59M (vs $118.5M)
- Exit: $472-708M (8-12x multiple)
- Return: **47-71x** (still top-decile venture)

**Verdict:** Even at 50% of plan, returns are attractive.

## BENCHMARKING

### UAE/MENA Fintech Comparables

| Company | Stage | Valuation | Revenue | Multiple | Outcome |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| Careem | Exit | $3.1B | $200M | 15.5x | Acquired by Uber |
| Tabby | Series D | $700M | $50M | 14x | Operating |
| Spotpay | Series A | $15M | $1.5M | 10x | Operating |
| **Nuqta (Target)** | **Year 5** | **$1.2B** | **$118.5M** | **10x** | **IPO/Strategic** |

**Nuqta at $1.2B would be:**
- 2nd largest UAE fintech after Careem
- Comparable to Tabby's trajectory
- **Requires 1.5M users, 10K merchants (achievable but hard)**

## COMPARABLE UAE PRE-SEED DEALS

| Company | Year | Amount | Cap | Traction | Outcome |
|---------|------|--------|-----|----------|---------|
| Tabby | 2020 | $500K | $7M | MVP, 50 merchants | $700M (Series D) |
| Spotpay | 2021 | $300K | $3M | Prototype only | $15M (Series A) |
| Ziina | 2020 | $400K | $4M | Beta, 100 users | $22M (Series A) |
| **Nuqta** | **2026** | **$400K** | **$5M** | **LOIs, no product** | **TBD** |

**Verdict:** Nuqta's $5M cap is **on the high side** for pre-product. $4M more appropriate.
