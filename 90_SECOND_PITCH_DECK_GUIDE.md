## 📊 SLIDE BREAKDOWN

### **SLIDE 0: COVER [Entry Point]**

**Purpose:** Brand impression + quick validation signals

**Content:**
- NUQTA logo (large, bold)
- Tagline: "The Everyday Savings Platform for the Middle East"
- Hook: "Turning Everyday Spending Into a Habit → Habits Into Defensibility"
- 3 Quick Stats:
  - $35B UAE Offline Market
  - 30+ Merchant LOIs Signed
  - Feb 28, 2026 Launch Date

**What to say (5 seconds):**
> "I'm Rejaul, founder of Nuqta — the everyday savings platform for the Middle East. Let me show you why this is a fundable opportunity."

---

### **SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM [0-15 Seconds]**

**Purpose:** Establish pain point + market size

**Content:**
- **Consumer Pain:**
  - AED 2.4B/year wasted (offline spending = zero rewards)
  - Fragmented rewards (points trapped in 15 apps)
  - No smart payment guidance

- **Merchant Pain:**
  - AED 5K Instagram ads → zero loyalty
  - Discounts decay (20% off today, gone tomorrow)
  - No repeat visits

**What to say (15 seconds):**
> "In the UAE and GCC, consumers lose billions every year because rewards are fragmented across banks, wallets, telcos, and merchants — while merchants burn margin on discounts that don't create loyalty. Everyone is spending money, but nobody is spending smartly."

**Key Insight Box:**
> "Everyone is spending money. Nobody is spending smartly."

---

### **SLIDE 2: WHAT NUQTA IS [15-30 Seconds]**

**Purpose:** Solution clarity + product positioning

**Content:**
- **Positioning:** "Neutral rewards + payment intelligence layer"
- **User Journey (4 Steps):**
  1. 🔍 Search: "Where should I eat?"
  2. 💳 Decide: "Which card saves most?"
  3. ✅ Pay: Use recommended method
  4. 💰 Earn: Get Nuqta Coins instantly

- **Differentiators (3 "No" statements):**
  - ❌ No Coupons (real-time intelligence)
  - ❌ No Subscriptions (free for users)
  - ✅ Real Savings (on everyday spending)

**What to say (15 seconds):**
> "Nuqta is a neutral rewards and payment intelligence layer. Before a user pays, we show them the best way to pay — card, wallet, BNPL — and after they pay, we reward them for making smarter choices. No coupons. No subscriptions. Real savings on everyday spending."

---

### **SLIDE 3: WHY THIS WORKS [30-45 Seconds]**

**Purpose:** Business model clarity + value prop

**Content:**
- **Transaction Loop Diagram:**
  - Discover → Decide → Pay → Earn → Repeat (loop back)
  - Visual: 5 connected circles with arrows

- **For Users:**
  > "Check before I pay" becomes automatic. Daily saving habit, not one-time deal hunting.

- **For Merchants:**
  > Pay only when real sale happens. Not for ads, not for hope — aligned incentives.

**What to say (15 seconds):**
> "Nuqta sits inside the transaction loop — discover, decide, pay, earn, repeat. That lets us build a daily saving habit, not one-time deal hunting. Merchants pay only when a real sale happens — not for ads, not for hope."

---

### **SLIDE 4: WHY GROUPON FAILED, WHY WE WIN [45-60 Seconds]**

**Purpose:** Competitive differentiation + retention thesis

**Content:**
- **Two-Column Comparison:**

**❌ Groupon (Sold Discounts):**
- One-time spikes (50% off today → gone)
- Merchant loses money (Groupon takes 50%)
- No retention (users chase next deal)
- **Result:** Discounts decay ⤵️

**✅ Nuqta (Builds Habits):**
- Repeat visits (earn coins every visit)
- Merchant wins (pay 15% only on redemptions)
- 30% D30 retention (daily habit)
- **Result:** Habits compound ⤴️

**What to say (15 seconds):**
> "Groupon sold discounts. Discounts decay. Nuqta builds habits. Habits compound. We reward repeat visits, not one-time spikes — which is why merchants stay and users return."

**Key Insight:**
> "Discounts decay. Habits compound."

---

### **SLIDE 5: MOAT & TIMING [60-75 Seconds]**

**Purpose:** Defensibility + competitive window

**Content:**
- **3 Structural Moats:**

1. **🛡️ Neutrality**
   - We recommend any card/wallet
   - Why Careem can't copy: Recommending Tabby cannibalizes Careem Pay Later

2. **💰 Incentive Alignment**
   - Merchants pay only on redemptions
   - Why it matters: We're aligned with merchants, not extracting from them

3. **📈 Behavioral Data**
   - 12 months of offline patterns compound
   - Why it's defensible: Can't be scraped, bought, or backfilled

- **Timing Window:**
  - **18-24 months** before Careem/Noon notice
  - Month 1-6: Too small to register
  - Month 7-12: Internal debate (3-6 months)
  - Month 13-24: Build or acquire decision

**What to say (15 seconds):**
> "Our moat is structural: neutrality incumbents can't copy, incentive alignment, and time-compounded offline behavior data that can't be scraped or bought. There's a 12-18 month window before Careem or Noon even notice this category."

---

### **SLIDE 6: WHY INVEST NOW [75-90 Seconds]**

**Purpose:** Traction + ask + closing statement

**Content:**
- **3 Readiness Signals:**
  - ✅ **Product Ready:** MVP launching Feb 28, dual coin system, 8-layer fraud defense
  - 💼 **30+ Merchants Signed:** LOIs with revenue-share, supply-side validated
  - 💵 **CAC <AED 40:** Merchant-led distribution, QR codes = free billboards, 9.4x LTV:CAC

- **The Ask (3 Numbers):**
  - **$400K** SAFE Investment
  - **$5M** Valuation Cap
  - **20%** Series A Discount

- **Tagline:** "No valuation pressure → Launch, prove retention, scale what works"

**What to say (15 seconds):**
> "The product is ready, merchants are lined up, and the GTM is disciplined: merchant-led distribution, habit-first retention, and CAC under AED 40. We're raising a SAFE with a 20% discount, no valuation pressure — to launch, prove retention, and scale what works."

**Closing Statement (in visual box):**
> "Nuqta turns everyday spending into a habit. Habits into defensibility. That's why this wins."
