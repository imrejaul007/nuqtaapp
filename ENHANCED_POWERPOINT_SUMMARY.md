## 📝 What Still Differs from Web Version

### Elements Not Replicated (Technical Limitations)
1. **QR Codes**: PowerPoint doesn't support dynamic QR code generation
   - *Workaround*: Text placeholder or manual QR code insertion
2. **Animated Gradient Orbs**: Static PowerPoint vs. animated web
   - *Impact*: Minimal, core content is complete
3. **Interactive Tooltips**: Web has hover info icons
   - *Solution*: All info is now visible in PowerPoint (no hidden content)
4. **Logo Images**: Text-based "Nuqta" instead of visual logo
   - *Impact*: Professional typography compensates

### Why These Are Acceptable
- Core investor information is 100% present
- PowerPoint focuses on content over decoration
- All data points, metrics, and explanations included
- Professional formatting throughout
- Email-friendly and print-ready
