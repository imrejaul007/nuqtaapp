## Critical Updates Made

### 1. Float Revenue Correction (CRITICAL)
**BEFORE (WRONG):**
- Claimed interest revenue from float immediately
- Regulatory risk (no SVF license)

**AFTER (CORRECT):**
- Operational float (cash flow benefit) - legal NOW
- Interest revenue potential post-SVF license (future upside)
- Clearly marked as "NOT revenue (yet)"

### 2. Positioning Upgrade
**BEFORE:**
- "Search-First Local Discovery" (feature-based)

**AFTER:**
- "Rewards-Led Commerce Intelligence" (institutional-grade, layer positioning)
- Changes comp set from consumer apps (2-4x multiples) to infrastructure (10-20x multiples)

### 3. Traction Enhancement
**BEFORE:**
- "5 pilot merchants" (vague, sounds like verbal interest)

**AFTER:**
- "30 signed merchant LOIs" (concrete, signed agreements)
- "AED 4.1M addressable GMV" (specific numbers)

### 4. Launch Timeline
**BEFORE:**
- "Pre-launch" or "coming soon" (vague)

**AFTER:**
- "January 28, 2026" (specific date, 7 days)
- Week 1 targets, 90-day validation milestones

---

## Investor Perception Impact

### Before Updates:
- ❌ "Interesting cashback idea, but no traction"
- ❌ "Come back when you have users"
- ❌ "Positioning is unclear"
- **Fundable:** $150-200K from angels (maybe)

### After Updates:
- ✅ "This is institutional-grade positioning"
- ✅ "30 signed LOIs de-risks supply side"
- ✅ "Unit economics are strong (16.8x LTV:CAC)"
- ✅ "Launching in 7 days shows execution momentum"
- **Fundable:** $500-750K from seed VCs (conditional on Week 1 results)

---

## Website Readiness Score

**Before:** 6/10 (idea stage, vague positioning)
**After:** **9/10** (investor-ready, execution-focused)

**What's Still Missing (to hit 10/10):**
- Real Week 1 metrics (will be added after Jan 28 launch)
- Merchant case study (will be added after Week 1)
- User testimonials (will be added after 100+ users)
