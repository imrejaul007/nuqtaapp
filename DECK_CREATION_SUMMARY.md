## 🎯 KEY TALKING POINTS

### **Hook (30 sec):**
"We're building the smart shopping super-app for UAE. Pre-launch, 95% product ready, 30 signed merchant contracts, 6-person team assembled. We're not idea-stage - we're execution-stage."

### **Traction (5 min):**
"Here's what we've de-risked: Product is 95% complete and launches in 30 days. We have 30 legally binding contracts with merchants representing AED 12 million in GMV potential. We've assembled a full 6-person team including 2 ex-founders. We're bootstrapped - haven't raised a single dirham yet. Most pre-seed startups are at idea-stage. We've eliminated 80% of execution risk."

### **Unit Economics (1 min):**
"Our LTV to CAC is 56.8 to 1. Industry benchmark is 3 to 1. We're 19 times better. We generate AED 67.50 gross margin per user per month. We recover our customer acquisition cost in 18 days. We're profitable from Month 1."

### **Moat (1 min):**
"We have 7 compounding moats, but the key one is POS lock-in. We give merchants a free POS and inventory system. This creates extremely high switching costs and gives us 12 to 18 months head start before Careem or Noon could replicate this."

### **Close (30 sec):**
"We're raising AED 1.85 million. 60% goes to customer acquisition across 10 channels, 25% to team expansion, 15% to final product launch. We'll use this to hit 50,000 users in Year 1 and raise our Series A. Our target is to close this round in Q1 2026 and launch 30 days after funding."
