# 🟣 NUQTA — HORIZON & PHASE-WISE GTM STRATEGY

### *Institutional-Grade Go-To-Market*

> **"Nuqta scales by first creating daily saving habits, then using merchants as distribution, and finally layering digital growth once unit economics are proven — city by city."**

---

## 🔒 GTM DISCIPLINE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Rule #1 — Only 3 Channels (First 6 Months)**
No "test everything". Focus beats curiosity.

**Rule #2 — Metrics > Vanity**
D7 / D30 retention > downloads. Weekly metric reviews.

**Rule #3 — Density Before Breadth**
Own one micro-market (Marina + Downtown) before expanding.

These rules are **signals of operator maturity**.

## 📈 HORIZON 2 — SCALE WITH PROOF

---

## NEW CATEGORIES (H2)

### 🏥 Healthcare

* High AOV (AED 150-300)
* Repeat behavior (monthly prescriptions)

### 🏠 Home Services
* **Target:** 50+ merchants

---

## GTM CHANNELS (H2)

* Afternoon: Pick up prescription (Healthcare) → 8% cashback
* Evening: Hair salon (Home Services) → 12% Brand Coin

**Result:** 3 touchpoints in one day → Strong habit reinforcement

---

### 3️⃣ Geographic Expansion (Parallel Track)

Once Marina/Downtown saturated with all 3 categories:
* **Abu Dhabi:** Corniche + Yas Island (50 merchants)
* **JLT + Business Bay:** Corporate crowd, high spend
* **Arabian Ranches:** Residential, family-focused

---

### 4️⃣ Digital Growth (NOW ALLOWED — GATED)

**Digital Ads UNLOCKED only if:**

* MAU ≥ 5,000
* Repeat rate ≥ 35%
* Merchant churn < 5%

**Channels**

---

## 🇶🇦 QATAR ENTRY GTM (3-4 Months)

### Why Qatar First?

**Timeline: ~10 Months (Parallel Launch) | Kuwait + Bahrain + Oman**

## 🎯 Objective

* Exit timing: Need full GCC coverage to maximize valuation

---

## GTM MOTION (ALL 3 COUNTRIES)

### Top-Down Strategy (Not Bottom-Up):

* **Enterprise clients** (banks, telcos, malls)
* **Merchant pre-onboarding** before consumer launch

### Same Core GTM Engine (Proven):
* Merchant QR (now at AED 10 CAC)
* University ambassadors
* Digital ads (Meta, Google)
* WaaS partnerships (banks, fintechs)

* ✅ Proof before expansion
* ✅ B2C foundation → B2B leverage
* ✅ UAE mastery → GCC replication
