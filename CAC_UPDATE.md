## ✅ Changes Made

### **1. Cover Slide (Slide 0)**
- **Before:** 95% Lower CAC
- **After:** 75-85% Lower CAC
- Calculation: (200 - 40) / 200 = 80% average reduction

### **2. Solution Overview (Slide 5) - For Merchants**
- **Before:** "Acquire high-intent customers at 95% lower CAC than Google Ads"
- **After:** "Acquire high-intent customers at 75-85% lower CAC than Google Ads"

### **3. Unit Economics (Slide 11)**
- **Customer CAC:**

  - After: **AED 30-50**
  - Method: Organic + referrals

- **LTV:CAC Ratio:**
  - Before: 60x (based on AED 3 CAC)
  - After: **3.6-6x** (based on AED 30-50 CAC)
  - Calculation:
    - LTV: AED 180 (Year 1)
    - CAC: AED 30-50
    - Ratio: 180/50 = 3.6x to 180/30 = 6x
  - Still above 3x industry standard ✓

## Updated Economics

### **Unit Economics Summary**
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Customer CAC | AED 30-50 | Organic + referrals |
| LTV (Year 1) | AED 180 | 12 transactions avg |
| LTV:CAC Ratio | 3.6-6x | vs 3x industry standard |

### **Comparison to Google Ads**
| Method | CAC | Reduction |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Google Ads | AED 200 | Baseline |
| Nuqta | AED 30-50 | 75-85% lower |

## Why This Makes Sense

### **Previous Numbers Were Unrealistic:**
- AED 3 CAC would mean:
  - 60x LTV:CAC ratio (too high to be believable)
  - 98.5% lower than Google Ads (unrealistic claim)
  - Would imply near-zero marketing spend

### **New Numbers Are Realistic:**
- AED 30-50 CAC means:
  - 3.6-6x LTV:CAC ratio (strong, industry-leading)
  - 75-85% lower than Google Ads (credible improvement)
  - Reflects real cost of organic + referral programs
  - Still shows clear competitive advantage
