# FIX KANG DECK - Make It Follow Your Storytelling Flow

## The Problem

You like the Kang deck (19 slides with all details), but it doesn't follow your storytelling flow.

**Current Order:**
1. Problem ✅
2. Why Now ❌ (breaks flow)
3. Solution ✅
4. Funnel ✅
5-8. Growth details (Flywheel, GTM, Why We Win, Competition)
9. Revenue ❌ (too far down - should be after Funnel!)
10. Market Size ❌ (buried - should be Slide 2!)

**Your Required Flow:**
1. Problem
2. **How Big (Market Size)** ← Move from Slide 10!
3. Solution
4. Funnel
5. **Revenue** ← Move from Slide 9!
6. **The Ask** ← Move from Slide 14!
7-17. Supporting details

## The Solution

### Option 1: Quick Fix (5 minutes)
I can rearrange the existing Kang deck to follow your flow:
- Move "Market Size" from Slide 10 → Slide 2
- Move "Business Model" from Slide 9 → Slide 5
- Move "The Ask" from Slide 14 → Slide 6
- Push all supporting slides (Why Now, Flywheel, GTM, etc.) to after Slide 6

**Result:**
- Same 19 slides, same content
- But NOW follows: Problem → How Big → Solution → Funnel → Revenue → Ask
- Core story in first 6 slides (3 minutes)
- Supporting details in slides 7-18

### Option 2: Hybrid (10 minutes)
Take the best of both:
- Rearrange like Option 1 (storytelling flow)
- BUT also remove some repetition:
  - Merge Flywheel + GTM into one slide
  - Merge Why We Win + Competition into one slide

**Result:**
- 15-16 slides (not 19, not 13)
- Perfect storytelling flow
- Less repetition than Kang, more detail than Final
- Best of both worlds

## Recommendation

Since you like the Kang deck's level of detail, I recommend **Option 1: Quick Fix**.

This gives you:
- ✅ All 19 slides (nothing removed)
- ✅ Perfect storytelling flow (Problem → How Big → Solution → Funnel → Revenue → Ask)
- ✅ Core story in 3 minutes
- ✅ All supporting details after

The ONLY change is the slide ORDER, not the content.

**A) Option 1** - Rearrange Kang deck (keep all 19 slides, just reorder)
**B) Option 2** - Hybrid (rearrange + remove some repetition = 15-16 slides)
**C) Something else** - Tell me what you want

Then I'll implement it immediately!
