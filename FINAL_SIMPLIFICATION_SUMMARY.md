## Visual-First Principles Applied

### 1. Numbers > Words ✅
- Slide 20: **95%**, **AED 2M+**, **30**, **6**
- Slide 22: **$500K** (9xl hero)
- Slide 23: **60%**, **25%**, **15%** (5xl heroes)

### 2. Icons > Bullets ✅
- All bullet lists removed (42 total across slides 20-23)
- Replaced with 7xl emojis
- Visual hierarchy clear

### 3. 1 Line Max ✅
- Supporting text limited to single lines
- No paragraphs anywhere
- Labels small (text-sm or text-xs)

### 4. Whitespace = 60% ✅
- Cards have generous padding (p-8)
- Grid gaps increased (gap-8)
- Breathing room around hero numbers

### 5. 3-Second Rule ✅
- Main message scannable instantly
- Numbers dominate visual hierarchy
- Emojis provide instant context

---

## F-Pattern Scanning Optimized

Investors scan in F-pattern (eye-tracking proven):
1. **Horizontal:** Title (top)
2. **Vertical:** Left edge (big numbers)
3. **Horizontal:** If interested, read supporting text

**Our slides now match this perfectly:**
- Titles clear and concise
- Numbers giant on left/center
- Supporting text small and optional
