## Decision 2: First 50 Merchants - Which Categories?

**Question:** Should we go deep in one category or spread across multiple?

**Option A: Go Deep (F&B Only)**
- 50 cafes/restaurants in Dubai Marina + JBR
- Pros: Easier operations, clear value prop, word-of-mouth within industry
- Cons: Limited user appeal, single point of failure

**Option B: Go Wide (Mixed Categories)**
- 25 F&B + 15 Salons + 10 Gyms
- Pros: Broader appeal, more use cases, better retention
- Cons: Complex operations, diluted focus

**Option C: Hybrid (F&B + 1 Adjacent)**

- Pros: Balance of focus and variety
- Cons: Still some complexity

**Current Leaning:** _[To discuss]_

**Decision Made:** _[Pending]_

## Decision 3: Pricing Model - Engine A vs Engine B Split

**Question:** Should we lead with 15% (Engine A) or offer lower rates to win merchants?

**Option A: Stick with 15% Engine A**
- Standard rate for F&B, Salons, Fitness
- Pros: Higher take rate, better unit economics
- Cons: Harder merchant sell, competitor undercut risk

**Option B: Launch with 10% Promotional Rate**
- First 3 months at 10%, then 15%
- Pros: Easier merchant acquisition, volume play
- Cons: Sets wrong expectation, harder to raise later

**Option C: Tiered from Day 1**

- Low-margin (Grocery): 5%
- Medium (Retail): 10%
- Pros: Fair, category-appropriate

**Current Leaning:** _[To discuss]_

**Decision Made:** _[Pending]_

## Decision 4: Solo Founder vs Co-Founder

**Question:** Should we actively seek a co-founder before raising?

**Option A: Stay Solo**
- Pros: Full control, faster decisions, full equity

- Cons: More expensive, less skin in game

**Current Leaning:** _[To discuss]_

**Decision Made:** _[Pending]_

## Decision 5: Fundraise Amount - $400K vs $600K

**Question:** Is $400K enough or should we raise more?

- Cons: Tight, no buffer for mistakes

**Option B: Raise $600K**
- 18-month runway
- Pros: More buffer, can hire faster, less stress
- Cons: Higher dilution, harder to close, higher expectations

**Option C: Raise $400K Now, Bridge Later**

- Pros: Flexibility, prove traction first
- Cons: Distraction of multiple raises

**Current Leaning:** _[To discuss]_

**Decision Made:** _[Pending]_

## Decision 6: UAE Only vs GCC from Day 1

**Question:** Should we mention GCC expansion in pitch or focus purely on UAE?

# STRATEGIC QUESTIONS TO THINK THROUGH

## Market & Competition

1. **Who is our real competitor?**
   - Entertainer? (Different model - subscription)
   - Groupon? (Dead in GCC)
   - Bank loyalty? (Fragmented, boring)
   - Instagram ads? (What merchants use today)
   - _My view:_ Our real competition is merchant inertia - doing nothing

2. **What if Careem/Talabat launches this?**
   - They have merchants, they have users
   - Our defense: Focus, speed, merchant relationships
   - _Counter-argument:_ They're focused on delivery, not in-store

3. **What's our unfair advantage?**
   - Not tech (can be copied)
   - Not capital (we have less)
   - Possibly: Speed of execution, merchant density in specific areas, founder obsession
   - _Need to think:_ Is this enough?

## Product & Users

4. **Why would users actually use this daily?**
   - Savings alone? (Maybe not sticky enough)
   - Gamification? (Leaderboards, streaks)
   - Social? (See what friends are saving)
   - _Hypothesis:_ Need multiple hooks, not just cashback

5. **What's our "aha moment"?**
   - First coin earned?
   - First redemption?
   - First AED 100 saved?
   - _Need data:_ Track activation events, find correlation

6. **What if D30 retention stays below 25%?**
   - Pivot to merchant SaaS?
   - Double down on gamification?
   - Change reward mechanics?
   - _Trigger:_ If D30 < 20% after 3 months, major product rethink

## Business Model

7. **Is 15% commission sustainable?**
   - Merchants paying 30% to Talabat for delivery
   - 15% for in-store seems fair
   - But do they see it that way?
   - _Risk:_ Race to bottom if competitors enter

8. **Should we charge merchants a setup fee?**
   - Current: Zero upfront
   - Alternative: AED 500 setup (filters serious merchants)
   - _Trade-off:_ Fewer merchants vs higher quality?

9. **What's our path to profitability?**
   - Current model: Take 12-15% of GMV
   - At AED 100M GMV = AED 12-15M revenue
   - Costs at scale: ~AED 5M?
   - _Math check:_ Need AED 50M GMV to break even?

## Fundraising

10. **What do investors really care about?**
    - Team (solo founder concern)
    - Market size (GCC story helps)
    - Traction (need to launch first)
    - Unit economics (need real data)
    - _Focus:_ Launch fast, get data, then raise

11. **SAFE vs Priced Round?**
    - SAFE: Faster, simpler, standard for pre-seed
    - Priced: More protection for founder, sets valuation
    - _Leaning:_ SAFE at $5M cap, 20% discount (standard)

12. **What's our walk-away point?**
    - Below $3M cap? Walk away
    - >30% discount? Walk away
    - Board seat at pre-seed? Walk away
    - _Know your limits before negotiating_

## Operations

13. **What breaks first when we scale?**
    - Merchant support? (Need ticketing system)
    - Settlements? (Need automation)
    - QR distribution? (Need logistics partner)
    - _Plan:_ Identify bottlenecks at 100, 250, 500 merchants

14. **When do we hire first employee?**
    - Option A: After funding secured
    - Option B: After 50 merchants (proof of model)
    - Option C: Before launch (build team first)
    - _Leaning:_ After 50 merchants, before funding closes

15. **What's the minimum viable team?**
    - Founder (BD + Strategy)
    - 1 Dev (contractor ok)
    - 1 Ops person (part-time ok)
    - _Total:_ 2.5 people can run to 250 merchants

# INVESTOR FAQ (Internal Prep)

## Questions They'll Ask & Our Answers

**Q: Why are you a solo founder?**
> A: I've deliberately stayed solo to move fast in the 0-to-1 phase. Once we have product-market fit, I'll bring on a co-founder or CTO. Right now, speed matters more than team size. I'm also working with [X advisors] who fill key gaps.

**Q: What if Careem does this?**
> A: Careem is focused on super-app for delivery and ride-hailing. In-store rewards is a different muscle - it requires merchant-by-merchant relationships, not platform plays. They're unlikely to prioritize this. If they do, they'll likely acquire rather than build. We'd be happy to have that conversation.

**Q: Why will merchants sign up?**
> A: Merchants are spending AED 50-100 per customer on Instagram ads with zero attribution. We offer them customers for free - they only pay when customers actually show up and spend. It's a no-brainer ROI.

**Q: What's your unfair advantage?**
> A: Three things: (1) Merchant density in specific areas - we're not spread thin, we own corridors. (2) Dual-engine model - we work with high-margin AND low-margin merchants, unlike pure cashback plays. (3) Speed - we can ship and iterate faster than any corporate.

**Q: How do you get to $100M GMV?**
> A: 500 merchants × AED 200K annual GMV each = AED 100M. That's just 2,000 transactions per merchant per year at AED 100 average ticket. Very achievable in 24-36 months.

**Q: What if users don't retain?**
> A: We're building multiple retention loops: (1) Daily savings streaks with bonuses, (2) Merchant discovery - new places to try, (3) Social - see what friends save, (4) Redemption anticipation - watching balance grow. If D30 stays below 20% after 3 months of iteration, we'll pivot the product, not abandon the market.

**Q: Why UAE?**
> A: UAE has the highest per-capita spending in MENA, most smartphone penetration (96%), most digitally-savvy consumers, and a merchant ecosystem that's hungry for alternatives to Instagram ads. It's the best launchpad for GCC expansion.
