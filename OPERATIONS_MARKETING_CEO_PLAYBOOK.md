# NUQTA OPERATIONS, MARKETING & CEO PLAYBOOK
## Complete Operational Guide for H1 2026 Launch

# PART 1: MARKETING STRATEGY

## 1.1 Marketing Philosophy

**Core Principle: Zero Paid Ads Until PMF**

We do NOT spend on paid advertising until we hit:
- 5,000 MAU (Monthly Active Users)
- 35% D30 Retention
- <5% Merchant Churn

**Why?** Paid ads without product-market fit = burning money. Our merchants ARE our marketing channel.
