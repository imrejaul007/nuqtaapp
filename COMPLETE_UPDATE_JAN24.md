## ✅ All Updates Complete

### **1. Business Model Clarification (Slide 9)**

**Updated 15% Commission Structure:**
- **5% Fixed Revenue** - Guaranteed commission (Nuqta's revenue)
- **5% Base Cashback** - Always goes to user as Nuqta Coins (redeemable across all merchants)
- **+5% Social Bonus** - Extra reward when user shares on social media
- **Result:** User gets 5-10% total in Nuqta Coins, Nuqta earns 5% + 10 AED/month subscription

**Example Calculation (AED 100 purchase):**
- Our Revenue: AED 5
- Base Cashback: AED 5 (user gets as Nuqta Coins)
- Social Bonus: AED 5 (if shared)
- Merchant Pays: AED 15 total

### **2. NEW SLIDE 10: Nuqta Coin vs Brand Coin**

**Complete explanation of dual reward system:**

#### **Nuqta Coin (Universal Currency)**
- 1 Nuqta Coin = 1 AED
- Works across ALL merchants on Nuqta
- **How users earn:**
  - 5% base on every purchase
  - +5% bonus when they share on social
  - Max 10% in Nuqta Coins per transaction
- **How users use:**
  - Pay partially or fully using coins
  - Use across categories (food, fashion, services)
  - Combine with card, EMI, or BNPL

#### **Brand Coin (Merchant-Specific)**
- 1 Brand Coin = 1 AED
- Only redeemable at the issuing merchant
- **How users earn:**
  - Merchant loyalty campaigns
  - Repeat purchase rewards
  - Example: Buy 3x → 200 Brand Coins
- **Why it exists:**
  - True loyalty without discounting
  - Incentivize repeat visits
  - Lower cost than flat discounts

**Smart Rule:** Nuqta Coin = Freedom | Brand Coin = Loyalty

### **3. GTM Channels Added (Slide 12)**

**New "Acquisition Channels" section:**
1. **College/University Fests**
   - On-campus activations

### **4. Payment Intelligence Layer (Slide 19 - Technology)**

**New section explaining pre-transaction optimization:**

**Three Components:**
1. **Smart Routing** - Routes payments to best bank partner based on user's card issuer and merchant
2. **Personalized Offers** - Shows card-specific deals (e.g., "Extra 5% with Emirates NBD Visa")
3. **Real-Time Analysis** - Analyzes payment method BEFORE checkout to maximize rewards and savings
