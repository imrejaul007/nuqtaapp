• Conservative (digital-primary): AED 90 → LTV:CAC 5.2x
All scenarios remain above 5x industry threshold
```
**Impact:** Shows stress-testing of CAC assumptions (AED 50-90 range).

## 💬 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR INVESTORS

### **Before Fixes:**
❌ "LTV:CAC is 10x but CAC is 38% below market average?"
❌ "Year 1 shows 50K users but only $24M GMV? Math doesn't work."
❌ "Deck says 10K merchants, roadmap says 5K. Which is it?"
❌ "Building a POS system on $400K budget?"
❌ "Q1 2026 is 8 weeks away with no product?"

**Investor reaction:** "Too many inconsistencies. Pass."

### **After Fixes:**
✅ "LTV:CAC is 8-10x with sensitivity down to 5.2x at AED 90 CAC. Conservative."
✅ "Year 1 GMV is based on 30K average MAU ramping up. Makes sense."
✅ "5K merchants consistently across all materials."
✅ "QR checkout Year 1, POS integration Year 2. Realistic scope."
✅ "Q2 2026 launch gives 12-16 weeks. More achievable."

**Investor reaction:** "Conservative, credible, well-thought-out. Let's talk."
