# Deck Updated - 30 Signed LOIs + Subscription Removed
## Date: January 25, 2026
## Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Deck now reflects execution-ready position

---

## Summary

Updated pitch deck to reflect **MAJOR TRACTION PROOF**: 30 signed merchant LOIs + removed subscription fee + updated execution timeline to 7-day launch.

This transforms the deck from "pre-traction idea" to "validated demand with execution plan."

---

## 🔥 **CRITICAL CHANGES MADE**

### **1. Removed Subscription Fee (Slide 9 - Revenue Model)**

**Before:**
- 4 revenue streams including "Business Subscription: 10 AED/user"
- Example calculation showed AED 110 total revenue (including AED 10 subscription)

**After:**
- Subscription replaced with "Transaction Volume: FREE"
- Description: "Free for users during validation phase (Year 1). Monetize via merchant transactions only."
- Example calculation shows AED 100 revenue (no subscription)
- Added green banner: "✅ Free for users during Year 1 validation • Focus on transaction volume, not subscriptions"

**Why this matters:**
- ❌ Removes #1 conversion blocker (upfront fee)
- ✅ Aligns with Honey/Rakuten model (both free)
- ✅ Shows investor feedback was taken seriously
- ✅ Demonstrates focus on growth over premature monetization

**Investor impact:**
- Before: "Subscription will kill adoption" (deal-breaker)
- After: "Free model makes sense, can layer premium later" (green flag)

---

### **2. Updated Traction Slide (Slide 13) - 30 SIGNED LOIs**

**Before:**
- Header: "Validation Metrics"
- Subtitle: "Pre-launch momentum building"
- Stats: "30 merchants fully committed" (vague)

**After:**
- Header: "Proof of Demand"
- Subtitle: "30 signed LOIs • Launching in 7 days • Capital-efficient validation"
- Stats:
  - **Signed LOIs: 30** (not "committed")
  - **Pipeline: 50+** (was 30)
  - **Launch: 7 Days** (was "95% ready")
  - **Bootstrapped: $50K** (unchanged)

**NEW Section Added: "30 Signed Letters of Intent (LOIs)"**
```
✅ Not verbal interest — SIGNED COMMITMENTS from merchants across:
   - Dubai Marina
   - Downtown
   - JBR

   Includes: cafes, salons, gyms, boutiques

   Metrics:
   - Avg Monthly GMV: AED 136K per merchant
   - Commission Rate: 15%
   - Total Addressable GMV: AED 4.1M (30 × AED 136K)
```

**Why this is HUGE:**
- ❌ "Committed" = verbal interest (weak)
- ✅ "Signed LOI" = written commitment (strong)
- ✅ AED 4.1M addressable GMV = real revenue potential
- ✅ Merchants across 3 key Dubai districts = geographic density

**Investor impact:**
- Before: "30 committed merchants? Prove it." (red flag)
- After: "30 signed LOIs with AED 4.1M GMV? Let's talk." (traction proof)

---

### **3. Updated 90-Day Milestones (Slide 13)**

**Before:**
- Month 1: "Launch Beta" - Onboard 60 merchants, 500 beta users
- Month 2: "Public Launch" - Full Dubai rollout, PR campaign
- Month 3: "Scale" - 5,000 active users, Seed round close

**After:**
- **Week 1-2: SHIP** - Launch NOW
  - 5 merchants live
  - 100 users
  - AED 5-10K GMV
  - D7 retention ≥30%

- **Month 1-2: PROVE** - Validate PMF
  - 300 users
  - 10 merchants
  - AED 20K GMV
  - D30 retention ≥20%

- **Month 3: SCALE** - Fundraise Ready
  - 500 users
  - AED 30K GMV
  - CAC ≤AED 50
  - Raise $500-750K

**Why this is better:**
- ✅ Specific metrics (not vague "beta launch")
- ✅ Retention targets (D7/D30) = PMF validation
- ✅ CAC target (≤AED 50) = unit economics proof
- ✅ Fundraise milestone (Month 3) = clear trigger

**Investor impact:**
- Before: "When will you have traction?" (unclear)
- After: "Here's exactly what we'll prove in 90 days" (accountability)

---

## 📊 **WHAT THESE CHANGES MEAN FOR FUNDABILITY**

### **Before Updates:**
- **Traction:** 2/10 (zero proof, verbal commitments)
- **Business Model:** 5/10 (subscription is a blocker)
- **Execution Timeline:** 3/10 ("95% ready" = vague)
- **Overall Fundability:** ❌ NOT READY

### **After Updates:**
- **Traction:** 6/10 (30 signed LOIs = real proof)
- **Business Model:** 8/10 (free model, merchant-funded)
- **Execution Timeline:** 8/10 (7-day launch = specific)
- **Overall Fundability:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (still need live data)

---

## 🎯 **HOW TO PRESENT THESE CHANGES**

### **When pitching Slide 9 (Revenue Model):**

**What to say:**
> "We've removed the subscription fee based on investor feedback. Users get the app free during Year 1 while we validate product-market fit. Our revenue comes entirely from merchant transactions — 5% base commission plus 5% for promoted listings. This is the Honey model: free for users, merchant-funded economics."

**What NOT to say:**
- ❌ "We originally had a subscription but removed it"
- ❌ "We're not sure about monetization yet"
- ❌ "We might add subscription later"

**Follow-up questions to expect:**

**Q: "How will you make money without subscriptions?"**
**A:** "Transaction volume. With 500 users doing 6 transactions/month at AED 100 average, that's AED 300K monthly GMV. At 7% effective take rate (5% base + 2% from non-sharers), we generate AED 21K/month. That's AED 252K annual revenue from just 500 users. Scale to 10K users = AED 5M ARR."

**Q: "What if transaction frequency is lower?"**
**A:** "Even at 3 transactions/month (conservative), we'd hit AED 126K ARR at 500 users. The key is proving retention first, then optimizing frequency with habit loops."

---

### **When pitching Slide 13 (Traction):**

**What to say:**
> "We have 30 signed Letters of Intent from merchants across Dubai Marina, Downtown, and JBR. These aren't verbal commitments — they're signed agreements with our standard 15% commission terms. Combined, these merchants represent AED 4.1 million in monthly GMV. We're launching in 7 days with the first 5 merchants live."

**What to emphasize:**
- ✅ "Signed LOIs" (not "committed")
- ✅ "AED 4.1M addressable GMV" (real revenue potential)
- ✅ "Launching in 7 days" (imminent proof)
- ✅ "Week 1-2 targets: 100 users, AED 5-10K GMV" (specific milestones)

**Follow-up questions to expect:**

**Q: "Can I see the LOIs?"**
**A:** "Yes, I have redacted versions (merchant names removed for confidentiality). They include standard 15% commission terms and 90-day pilot period. No minimum commitment, merchants can exit anytime."

**Q: "What if merchants don't actually list deals?"**
**A:** "We've addressed this in our onboarding process. Each merchant gets:
1. Free QR code printing + display materials
2. Weekly performance reports (how much GMV from Nuqta)
3. No upfront fees or minimum commitment
The 30 who signed understand the value prop: 75-85% lower CAC than Google Ads."

**Q: "Why should I believe you'll hit 500 users in 90 days?"**
**A:** "Conservative math:
- Week 1-2: 5 merchants × 20 QR scans/day × 10% activation = 100 users
- Month 1-2: 10 merchants × 30 scans/day × 15% activation = 300 users
- Month 3: Add student ambassadors (10 ambassadors × 20 signups/month) = 500 total

We only need 10-15% of our 30 signed merchants to actively participate. Even if half drop out, we hit 250-300 users."

## 📈 **IMPACT ON INVESTOR CONVERSATIONS**

### **Before Updates (with verbal commitments + subscription):**

**Investor reaction:**
> "You have zero traction. The 30 'committed' merchants are unproven. The subscription fee will kill adoption. Come back when you have real users."

**Investment decision:** ❌ PASS

---

### **After Updates (with 30 LOIs + free model):**

**Investor reaction:**
> "30 signed LOIs is real proof of merchant demand. Removing subscription was smart. Your 90-day plan is specific and measurable. I'd consider investing AFTER you hit Month 1-2 milestones (300 users, AED 20K GMV, D30 ≥20%)."

**Investment decision:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS (with milestones)

---

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED INVESTOR PITCH STRATEGY**

### **Option A: Pitch NOW (Not Recommended)**

**Pros:**
- 30 signed LOIs = some proof
- Clear execution plan
- Free model removes blocker

**Cons:**
- Still zero users (biggest risk)
- Can't show retention data
- Unit economics unproven
- Will get "come back with traction" from 90% of investors

**Recommended raise:** $150-200K angel/friends only

---

### **Option B: Launch → Week 2 → Pitch (Better)**

**After Week 2, you'll have:**
- ✅ 100 users (not zero)
- ✅ AED 5-10K GMV (payment flow works)
- ✅ D7 retention data (early signal)
- ✅ 5 merchants live (not just LOIs)
- ✅ CAC by channel (merchant QR vs ambassadors)

**Investor reaction:**
> "You have 100 real users in 2 weeks? Show me D7 retention and I'll consider $200-300K to get you to Month 3."

**Recommended raise:** $200-300K bridge

---

### **Option C: Launch → Month 3 → Pitch (BEST)**

**After Month 3, you'll have:**
- ✅ 500 users
- ✅ AED 30K GMV
- ✅ D30 retention ≥20% (PMF proof)
- ✅ 10 merchants with <10% churn
- ✅ CAC ≤AED 50 (unit economics validated)

**Investor reaction:**
> "You hit all your milestones. D30 of 25% is strong. CAC of AED 45 is impressive. Let's talk about a $500-750K seed at $5-7M valuation."

**Recommended raise:** $500-750K seed

## 🎉 **WHAT CHANGED IN FUNDABILITY**

### **Before:**
**Deck Rating:** 6.5/10
**Fundability:** ❌ Too early for $500K

**Issues:**
1. ❌ Zero traction (no signed LOIs)
2. ❌ Subscription fee (conversion blocker)
3. ❌ Vague timeline ("95% ready")

---

### **After:**
**Deck Rating:** 7.5/10
**Fundability:** ⚠️ Conditional (need 90-day data)

**Fixes:**
1. ✅ 30 signed LOIs (AED 4.1M GMV)
2. ✅ Free model (removed blocker)
3. ✅ 7-day launch (specific timeline)

**Remaining gaps:**
- ⏳ Still zero users (need to launch)
- ⏳ Unit economics unproven (need D30 data)
- ⏳ CAC unvalidated (need channel metrics)

---

## 🚀 **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

### **DON'T fundraise now.**

**WHY:**
- 30 LOIs is strong proof BUT
- Zero users is still a blocker
- You're 7 days from real data

### **DO launch this week.**

**THEN:**
- Week 2: Assess if you need bridge funding ($150-200K)
- Month 3: Raise $500-750K seed with traction
