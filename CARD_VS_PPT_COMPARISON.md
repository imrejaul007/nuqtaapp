## 📊 Impact Analysis

### If We Enhance PowerPoint:

**File Size Increase**: 104KB → ~250KB (still email-friendly)
**Content Parity**: 50% → 85%+

**Benefit**: Investors get complete picture in PowerPoint, matching website quality

### If We Keep As Is:

**Investment of Time**: 0 hours
**File Size**: 104KB (optimized)
**Content Parity**: ~50%

**Risk**: Investors who only see PowerPoint miss key differentiators

## ✅ My Recommendation

**Enhance the PowerPoint one-pager to include:**

### Must-Have Additions:
1. ✅ Competitive comparison table (Panel 3)
2. ✅ Use of funds breakdown (Panel 3)
3. ✅ GTM phases with timeline (Panel 3)
4. ✅ Detailed moat explanations (Panel 6)
5. ✅ Dual coin system visual (Panel 5)

### Nice-to-Have:
6. ⚠️ Visual metric cards (all panels)
7. ⚠️ QR code mentions/placeholders
8. ⚠️ Enhanced visual design

This would bring content parity from **50% to 80-85%** while keeping file size under 300KB.
