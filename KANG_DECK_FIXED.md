## 🎉 What This Fixes

### BEFORE (Wrong Order):
```
Slide 1: Problem
Slide 2: Why Now ❌ (interrupts story)
Slide 3: Solution
Slide 4: Funnel
Slide 5-8: Growth details (4 slides)
Slide 9: Revenue ❌ (too far - after 8 slides!)
Slide 10: Market Size ❌ (buried!)
```

**Investor Experience:**
- Minute 1: "Okay, problem is clear"
- Minute 2: "Why now? But I don't know the scale yet..."
- Minute 3-4: "Growth details... but where's the market size?"
- Minute 5: "Finally revenue model, but why so late?"
- Minute 6: "Oh, the market is $150B! Should have told me that earlier!"

### AFTER (Correct Order):
```
Slide 1: Problem ✅
Slide 2: Market Size (HOW BIG!) ✅
Slide 3: Solution ✅
Slide 4: Funnel ✅
Slide 5: Revenue ✅
Slide 6: The Ask ✅
Slides 7-17: Supporting details
```

**Investor Experience:**
- Minute 1: "Clear problem"
- Minute 1.5: "WOW, $150B market!" 🤩
- Minute 2: "Smart solution"
- Minute 2.5: "Funnel proves it works"
- Minute 3: "Revenue model makes sense"
- Minute 3: "I'm interested! What's the ask?"
- Minutes 4-8: "Let me see the supporting details..."
