## 💯 FINAL RATING

### As a Senior Investor: **9/10** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why 9 instead of 10:**
- Missing 3 slides for perfect story:
  - Slide 8: Platform Definition (What we ARE vs NOT)
  - Slide 9: Transaction Economics (Money flow Sankey)
  - Slide 10: How It Works (User funnel + screenshots)

**Current gaps:**
- Jumps from "Solution" (Slide 7) straight to "Business Model" (Slide 8)
- Should have 2-3 more slides explaining HOW the solution works before showing business metrics

**But this is STILL investor-ready at 9/10.**
