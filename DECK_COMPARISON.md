### **New Kang Deck Narrative:**
**5-Act Structure:**

**Act 1 - Setup (Slides 1-2):**
"Meet Sara. She's losing AED 150/month. UAE market wastes AED 2.4B annually."

**Act 2 - Solution (Slides 3-4):**
"Nuqta solves this with complete 5-step journey. Market is AED 50B."

**Act 3 - Proof (Slides 5-8):**
"We already executed (Traction). Product is real. Business model works. Economics are exceptional."

**Act 4 - Path (Slides 9-10):**
"We'll scale via 10 channels with AED 18-22 CAC. 7 moats protect us."

**Act 5 - Close (Slides 11-12):**
"Rare founder who already proved it. Give us AED 1.85M to scale to 50K users."
