## ⚠️ **RED FLAGS (What to Watch For)**

### **Product Issues:**
- ❌ D7 retention <20% → Onboarding is broken, fix immediately
- ❌ CAC >AED 50 → Merchant QR isn't working, pivot to digital
- ❌ Payment failures >10% → Technical issue, critical bug
- ❌ Users download but don't transact → Value prop unclear

### **Merchant Issues:**
- ❌ Merchants remove QR codes → They don't see value, improve dashboard
- ❌ Merchants don't list deals → Onboarding unclear, simplify process
- ❌ 0 transactions from a merchant → QR placement wrong, visit location

### **User Issues:**
- ❌ Users transact once, never return → No habit formation, add push notifications
- ❌ Users sign up but don't activate → Friction in flow, optimize onboarding
- ❌ Negative feedback in WhatsApp group → Listen and fix fast

---

## 🔥 **CRITICAL: DO NOT SKIP**

1. **Daily metrics tracking**
   - Even if progress is slow, TRACK IT
   - "We had 5 signups today" is better than "I think we got a few"

2. **Weekly investor update**
   - Send every Friday, no matter what
   - Even if metrics are bad: "Week 1: 30 users (target 100). Here's why and how we'll fix it."

3. **Merchant check-ins**
   - Visit each merchant location mid-week
   - Are QR codes visible? Any issues?
   - "How many customers scanned? Any feedback?"

4. **User feedback loop**
   - WhatsApp group with first 50 users
   - Ask: "What's confusing? What would make you use this daily?"
   - Fix top 3 friction points each week
