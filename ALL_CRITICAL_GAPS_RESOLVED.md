## 🎯 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR FUNDRAISING

**Q: "What are your 5-year projections?"**
✅ A: "Year 1: $150K → Year 5: $38M revenue with 60% EBITDA margin. Break-even in Year 3." (Slide 19)

**Q: "When do I get my money back and how much?"**
✅ A: "Target exit in 48 months at $200-400M valuation, translating to 67-133x returns for pre-seed investors. Conservative scenario is 4-5x in 18 months at Series A." (Slide 20)

✅ A: "We have clear strategic interest from 3 tiers: Super apps (Careem, Noon), Fintech (Tabby, Delivery Hero), and Banks (Emirates NBD). MENA has proven this works - Careem sold for $3.1B in 2019." (Slide 20)

**Q: "How do you justify your valuation?"**

   - Show: Search → Merchant → QR scan → Coins credited flow

3. **Team Details** (🟡 Important)

   - OR remove placeholders and show "Key Hires Planned"

4. **Market Data Sources** (🟡 Important)

   - Use DataPoint components with tooltips

5. **Risk Mitigation Slide** (🟡 Important)

## 🎤 ELEVATOR PITCH (Using New Slides)

**30-second version:**
> "We're Nuqta - think of us as the universal rewards card for the UAE. Shoppers earn cashback everywhere they go, merchants get performance-based marketing that only charges when it works. We're raising $400K to acquire our first 500 merchants and 75K users, targeting break-even by Year 3 and a strategic exit in 48 months at 67-133x returns for early investors. We already have 30 LOIs signed."

**2-minute version:**
> "UAE residents waste AED 2.4 billion annually on loyalty programs that don't work and deals they never find. Merchants waste AED 12 billion on blind ads they can't measure.
>
> Nuqta solves both problems. For users: one app, earn cashback everywhere, use it anywhere. For merchants: only pay when customers walk in, no upfront costs, real attribution.
>
> Our unit economics are exceptional - 10x LTV to CAC ratio. We project $150K revenue in Year 1, hitting break-even in Year 3, and scaling to $38M by Year 5 with 60% EBITDA margins.
>
> We have clear exit paths. Careem, Noon, and Tabby all want what we're building. Comparable MENA exits show 8-12x revenue multiples. At our projected Year 4 revenue, that's a $200-400M exit, translating to 67-133x returns for pre-seed investors.
>
> We're raising $400K to launch in Dubai with 500 merchants and 75K users. We already have 30 LOIs signed. Your $400K turns into $17-35 million in 4 years."
