## 📱 USER ACQUISITION STRATEGIES

### 1. COLLEGE BUSINESS FEST

**Target:** 2,000-3,000 downloads per event

**Investment:**
- AED 200,000 (raw materials for 20 student sellers)
- AED 100,000 (winner seed funding)
- **Total: AED 300,000 per event**

**Mechanics:**
1. Students download Nuqta → Get FREE 100 Nuqta Coins (expires same day)
2. At College Fest: Pay with Nuqta = 50% off + cashback
3. Other payment methods = NO discount
4. Share on social media = 20% additional cashback

**Student Sellers (20 per event):**
- Nuqta invests AED 10,000 per seller in raw materials
- Students sell at fest with 200% margin
- 50% Nuqta discount = still 50% margin for student
- Students keep 80% profit, Nuqta takes 20%
- Winner gets AED 100,000 seed funding

**ROI:**
- 2,500 downloads (average)
- CAC: AED 300,000 ÷ 2,500 = **AED 120/user**
- BUT: Materials investment returned via 20% of sales
- Adjusted CAC: **AED 80/user**
