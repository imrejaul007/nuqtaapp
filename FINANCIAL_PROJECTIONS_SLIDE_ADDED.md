## 🎯 INVESTOR RESPONSE EXPECTED

✅ "What's your 3-5 year revenue trajectory?"
✅ "When do you break even?"
✅ "What's my exit scenario and timeline?"

💡 "How do you defend against Careem copying you?"
💡 "What if retention is lower than 85%?"

**These are GOOD questions** because they show investor engagement and allow you to showcase:
- Unit economics resilience
- Competitive moats (network effects, data)

## 💬 SUGGESTED INVESTOR PITCH LANGUAGE

**When presenting this slide, say:**

*"Let me show you our 5-year financial trajectory. We start with $400K pre-seed, which gets us through the first two phases proving unit economics."*

*"By Year 3, we hit break-even with 30% EBITDA margins on $3.7M revenue. This is critical — we're cash-flow positive in just 3 years, significantly faster than typical marketplaces."*

*"Years 4 and 5 are pure scale. We expand to 40-60% EBITDA margins, which is standard for platform businesses with network effects. By Year 5, we're doing $38M in revenue with 2 million users across the GCC."*

*"At 8-12x revenue multiples — which is standard for profitable marketplaces in this region — we're looking at a $304M to $456M exit. For your $400K investment today, that's a 76x to 114x return in 5 years."*

*"And these are conservative assumptions: 7.5% take rate, validated CAC, proven retention numbers. If we execute well, these numbers could be significantly higher."*
