## 1.3 Objection Preparation

### The 10 Objections You'll Face

**1. "We don't know you / You're too small"**
> "That's why we propose a zero-risk pilot. One pavilion, 2 weekends. If it fails, you've lost nothing. If it works, you have real data to scale."

**2. "We can build this ourselves"**
> "Building costs AED 2-5M and 12-18 months. With Nuqta, you're live in 2 weeks at AED 0. Pilot with us first - if you love the model, you can always build later with real data."

**3. "Our merchants won't pay 5-8%"**
> "They only pay on Nuqta-driven sales. Zero customers = zero fee. They're already paying 15-30% to delivery apps. Plus, AED 300 minimum means higher AOV - they make more even after commission."

**4. "Visitors won't download another app"**
> "Their AED 30 ticket becomes free money. Coins expire in 24 hours - FOMO drives downloads. Plus, Nuqta works across all of UAE, not just GV. Download once, use everywhere."

**5. "What if it hurts our brand?"**
> "It's co-branded 'GV Rewards powered by Nuqta'. You approve all messaging. Kill switch available - 7-day termination. Pilot limits exposure to one pavilion."

**6. "We're talking to someone else"**
> "Great - let's pilot alongside them. Different pavilions, let results decide. Are they offering zero cost, 10% revenue share, and 2-week launch?"

**7. "We need board approval"**
> "Happy to prepare a board one-pager. Can we do a small operational pilot first, then take real data to the board?"

**8. "Timing isn't right"**
> "This requires AED 0 budget. Let's sign LOI now, launch when ready. Or pilot in the last month as a test run for next season."

**9. "We tried this before and it failed"**
> "What went wrong? Our model is designed to avoid common failures - receipt scanning (no POS integration), coin expiry (no liability), revenue share (aligned incentives). Zero risk to try a different approach."

**10. "We want exclusivity"**
> "We can offer seasonal exclusivity - no competing winter events. You also get preferred 10% revenue share locked in forever as our first major partner. Full exclusivity would limit our ability to serve you well."

# PART 2: DURING THE MEETING

## 2.1 Meeting Structure (45-60 minutes)

| Phase | Time | Goal |
|-------|------|------|
| **Intro & Rapport** | 5 min | Build connection |
| **Discovery** | 10 min | Understand their needs |
| **Presentation** | 15 min | Show the opportunity |
| **Discussion** | 15 min | Handle questions/objections |
| **Close** | 5 min | Get commitment to next step |

---

## 2.2 Opening Script (First 5 Minutes)

**Walk in:**
> "Hi [Name], great to meet you. Thank you for taking the time."

**Small talk (1-2 minutes max):**
- Comment on something in their office
- Ask about their day/week
- Mention something from their LinkedIn if relevant

**Transition to business:**
> "I know your time is valuable, so let me share why I think this could be exciting for Global Village, and then I'd love to hear your thoughts."

**60-Second Pitch:**
> "Nuqta is a loyalty platform that turns every GV ticket into guaranteed spending. Here's the simple version: when someone buys an AED 30 ticket, they get AED 30 in GV Coins. But they can only use those coins if they spend AED 300 or more. This means every visitor is now motivated to spend more, and you get full visibility into what they're buying. We're proposing a zero-cost pilot with India Pavilion - if it works, you could see AED 200-400M in tracked GMV and earn 10% of our revenue. If it doesn't work, you've lost nothing."

---

## 2.3 Discovery Questions (Ask Before Presenting)

> "Before I dive into the details, I'd love to understand a few things..."

**About Their Priorities:**
1. "What are the biggest challenges you're focused on this season?"
2. "How do you currently track visitor spending inside the park?"
3. "What feedback do you get from merchants about traffic and sales?"

**About Decision Process:**
4. "If this looks interesting, what would the decision process look like?"
5. "Who else would need to be involved in evaluating this?"
6. "What timeline are you working with for new initiatives?"

**About Past Experience:**
7. "Have you tried any loyalty or rewards programs before?"
8. "What worked and what didn't?"

**Listen carefully** - their answers tell you exactly how to position Nuqta.

---

## 2.4 Presentation Tips

### Do's
- Stand if possible (more energy)
- Use their name occasionally

3. **Answer directly** - Don't ramble
4. **Check** - "Does that answer your question?"

**If you don't know the answer:**
> "That's a great question. I don't want to give you inaccurate information, so let me get back to you on that by [tomorrow/end of day]."

**Write down every question** - you'll need them for follow-up.

---

## 2.6 Closing the Meeting

**5 minutes before end:**

> "I'm mindful of your time. Let me summarize and suggest next steps..."

> "Great! Can we schedule a follow-up next week to discuss the pilot details? I'll send over the proposal document today."

**If they need to think:**
> "Totally understand. When would be a good time for me to follow up? I'll send you the one-pager and pilot proposal to review."

**If they're skeptical:**
> "I hear your concerns. Would it help if I [addressed specific concern]? Or perhaps we could do an even smaller test - just one weekend?"

Hi [Name],

Came across this article about [relevant topic - e.g., "how theme parks are using loyalty programs"] and thought of our conversation.

Still keen to explore the pilot when you're ready.

Hi [Name],

I wanted to check in directly - is the Nuqta partnership still something GV is interested in exploring?

If timing is bad: Let me know when would be better to reconnect.

Appreciate your honesty either way.

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right for this partnership.

Wishing you and the GV team a successful season.

Best,
Rejaul
