4. **Proof (2 min):** "30 LOIs signed, launching in 7 days, you'll be first 50"

**Materials to Bring:**
- One-pager with value prop
- QR code sample
- LOI template (non-binding)
- Commission calculator (show merchant P&L impact)

**Objection Handling:**
- "15% is too high" → Show they're currently spending 25%+ on ads + aggregators

## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Initial Outreach (Cold Email)

**Subject:** Driving foot traffic to [Merchant Name] with zero upfront cost

Hi [Owner/Manager Name],

I'm Rejaul, founder of Nuqta — a new platform launching next week to help Dubai merchants like [Merchant Name] drive foot traffic without upfront ad spend.

**The Problem:** You're currently spending 20-30% of revenue on Instagram ads, Google Ads, or aggregators like Talabat — but you only pay when someone clicks, not when they actually buy.

**Our Solution:** With Nuqta, you only pay 15% commission AFTER the customer walks in, makes a purchase, and posts about your store on social media.

**Why This Works:**
✅ Zero upfront cost
✅ Pay only for guaranteed sales
✅ Get authentic UGC content (worth AED 500-1K per post)
✅ Full attribution tracking

We've signed 30+ merchants in Dubai Marina, JBR, and Downtown. I'd love to offer [Merchant Name] a spot in our first 50.

Can we grab 10 minutes this week? I'm based in [area] and can swing by.

Best,
Rejaul Karim
Founder, Nuqta
+971 [number]
[email]

### Template 2: Follow-Up (No Response After 3 Days)

**Subject:** Re: Driving foot traffic to [Merchant Name]

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up on my email below. We're launching in 4 days and locking in our first 50 merchants.

Here's what [Similar Merchant] in [nearby area] said after signing:

*"We spend AED 10K/month on Instagram ads with no way to track ROI. With Nuqta, we only pay when someone actually buys. It's a no-brainer."*

I've attached a one-pager. If you're interested, let's schedule 10 minutes before Friday.

Thanks,
Rejaul

---

### Template 3: Post-Meeting Thank You

**Subject:** Thanks for meeting — Nuqta Partnership Next Steps

Hi [Name],

Great speaking with you today! Excited about the potential to drive [specific benefit they mentioned — e.g., "fill your Thursday lunch slots" or "promote your new brunch menu"].

**Next Steps:**
1. I'll send the Merchant Agreement by tomorrow (simple 2-page contract)
2. Once signed, we'll create your profile and QR codes (ready in 48 hours)
3. Launch target: [Date] — your store will be live to 1,000+ early users

One thing I forgot to mention: Merchants in our first 50 get a "Founding Partner" badge on the app (gives you prime placement in search results for 6 months).

Let me know if you have questions. Looking forward to partnering!

Best,
Rejaul

---

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Slow Merchant Sign-Ups
**Mitigation:**
- Lower Month 1 target to 30 merchants (instead of 50)
- Focus on "easy yes" categories: Cafes, male grooming, boutique fitness
- Offer first 30 days commission-free (Nuqta absorbs 15% to prove model)

### Risk 2: Merchant Churn After Month 1
**Mitigation:**
- Weekly check-ins with every merchant
- Quick payout (Net 7, not Net 30)
- Show ROI report: "You got X new customers worth AED Y lifetime value"
- Offer Brand Coins to increase repeat rate

### Risk 3: Low Transaction Volume Per Merchant
**Mitigation:**
- Better QR placement (test 3 locations in store)
- Staff training (incentivize staff: AED 5 per scan?)
- Merchant-side promo: "Scan QR and get extra 2% cashback" (merchant-funded)
- Feature low-performing merchants in app push notifications

---

## 🎯 MONTH 5 EXIT GATE CHECKLIST

By Week 20 (End of Month 5), you MUST have:

☑ **250+ merchants live** (100 F&B, 75 Salons/Fitness, 20 Grocery, 55 Fashion)
☑ **90%+ merchant retention** (at least 225 of first 250 still active)
☑ **Average 6+ transactions/merchant/week** (proves merchant value)
☑ **3+ merchant case studies** (written testimonials + ROI data)
☑ **Merchant NPS 8+** (prove satisfaction for Series A pitch)
☑ **Payment processing live** (Stripe/PayTabs integrated, weekly payouts working)
☑ **Scalable onboarding process** (can add 50 merchants/week in H2)

If you hit these, you're ready for H2 (target: 500 merchants by Month 12).

## 🚀 LET'S GO!

You have the list. You have the playbook. You have the pitch.

**Your job for Week 1:**
1. Contact 50 merchants from the list (10/day)
2. Schedule 15 meetings (30% response rate)
3. Sign 10 LOIs (60% conversion)
4. Get 5 contracts signed (50% follow-through)

**Remember:**
- You're not selling a product, you're offering a partnership
- Every "no" is data (track objections, refine pitch)
- Focus on relationships, not just numbers
- First 50 merchants are your founding partners — treat them like gold

Let's build Nuqta together. 🚀
