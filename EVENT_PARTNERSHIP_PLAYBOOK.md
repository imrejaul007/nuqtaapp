# NUQTA EVENT PARTNERSHIP PLAYBOOK
## Global Village & Large Event Strategy

---

# THE BIG IDEA

> **"Nuqta is not a rewards app. Nuqta is a temporary city commerce OS."**

We become the **digital spending layer** for large events - handling wallets, payments, loyalty, and merchant dashboards so event organizers don't have to build anything.

# PART 1: GLOBAL VILLAGE COIN MODEL

## 1.1 Core Concept: Ticket → Coin Conversion

**When visitor buys a Global Village ticket:**

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | User buys ticket (AED 30) via Nuqta or at gate |
| 2 | User receives **100% value as Global Village Coins** (30 coins) |
| 3 | Coins are **valid for 24 hours only** |
| 4 | Coins **only redeemable inside Global Village** |
| 5 | Coins **unlock on minimum spend of AED 300** |

**Psychology:**
> "Entry is FREE if I shop" → instant spending motivation

---

## 1.2 Why This Is Genius

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Drives same-day spending** | Coins expire in 24 hours - must spend now |
| **Keeps money inside Global Village** | Can't use coins anywhere else |
| **No long-term liability** | Coins expire, no balance sheet issues |
| **Forces discovery** | Must spend AED 300+, so users explore multiple stores |
| **Global Village funds it** | Using ticket value, not cash burn |

---

## 1.3 Redemption Rules

```
GLOBAL VILLAGE COIN RULES:
├── Valid: 24 hours from ticket purchase
├── Where: Only inside Global Village stores
├── Minimum bill: AED 300 to unlock redemption
├── Can split across: 1 or multiple stores (your refinement)
├── Expiry: Unused coins disappear at midnight
└── No withdrawal: Cannot convert to cash
```

**Why AED 300 minimum:**
- Prevents micro-abuse (buying AED 5 snack with AED 30 coin)
- Pushes higher AOV
- Encourages multi-store browsing
- Merchants LOVE bigger bills

---

## 1.4 Dual Coin Earning (The Flywheel)

**On every purchase inside Global Village, user earns:**

| Coin Type | Value | Validity | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Global Village Coins** | 5-10% of purchase | 24 hours, event-only | Same-day spending |
| **Nuqta Coins** | 5% of purchase | Permanent, universal | Future spending anywhere |

**Why dual coins work:**
- **Global Village Coins** → Immediate reinvestment in the park
- **Nuqta Coins** → Long-term retention outside Global Village
- User becomes Nuqta user forever, not just for one event

---

## 1.5 QR Code = Distribution Hack

**Each store has a Nuqta QR Code that handles:**
- Payment acceptance
- Coin redemption
- Coin earning
- Transaction tracking
- Real-time analytics

**Why QR works for events:**
- No POS integration needed
- Merchant onboarding = **5 minutes**
- Offline → online user capture
- Works with temporary/seasonal vendors
- Scales to 500+ merchants instantly

---

# PART 2: WHAT GLOBAL VILLAGE GETS

## 2.1 Their 5 Priorities (Map Your Pitch Here)

| Priority | What They Want | How Nuqta Delivers |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Footfall** | More visitors | Cashback on tickets drives purchases |
| **GMV** | Higher in-park spending | AED 300 minimum unlocks coins |
| **Merchant happiness** | Vendors make money, renew stalls | Higher bills, more customers |
| **Brand control** | No reputation risk | Global Village controls all rules |
| **Low risk** | No operational headaches | Nuqta handles everything |

---

## 2.2 The Math (Show Them This)

```
SCENARIO:
├── Visitors: 1,000,000 (season)
├── Ticket price: AED 30
├── Coin value: AED 30 (100% of ticket)
├── Redemption threshold: AED 300
├── Redemption rate: 40% (conservative)
└── Average uplift per redeemer: AED 200 extra spend

RESULT:
├── Redeemers: 400,000 visitors
├── Extra spend per redeemer: AED 200
├── Total GMV uplift: AED 80,000,000
├── Merchant commission (15%): AED 12,000,000
└── Nuqta revenue: AED 12M (from merchant commission)

GLOBAL VILLAGE COST: AED 0
GLOBAL VILLAGE BENEFIT: +AED 80M GMV, happier merchants
```

---

## 2.3 Who Pays for the Coins?

**Critical point for investors:**

| Source | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Ticket value** | Ticket money becomes coin (no extra cost) |
| **Merchant commission** | 15-20% on coin redemptions |
| **No Nuqta burn** | We don't subsidize anything |

> "Global Village doesn't spend extra. They convert ticket value into guaranteed in-park spending."

---

# PART 3: WHAT MERCHANTS GET

## 3.1 Merchant Value Proposition

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **No mandatory discounts** | They set their own prices |
| **No subsidy required** | They don't fund the coins |
| **No POS replacement** | Works with existing systems |
| **Higher bills** | AED 300 minimum drives bigger purchases |
| **More customers** | Users MUST spend to redeem coins |
| **Instant onboarding** | QR code setup in 5 minutes |

---

## 3.2 Merchant Commission Structure

| Tier | Commission | When |
|------|------------|------|
| **Standard** | 15% | On all coin redemptions |
| **Premium placement** | 12% | High-volume vendors |
| **Anchor stores** | 10% | Exclusive deals for flagships |

**Key message to merchants:**
> "You don't lose margin. You gain volume."

---

## 3.3 Merchant Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "15% is too high" | "You only pay when customers spend. No customers = no fee." |
| "I don't want discounts" | "You don't give discounts. Global Village funds the coins from tickets." |
| "I already have loyal customers" | "Great - they'll now bring friends who have coins to spend." |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | "You pay nothing until it works. Zero risk." |

---

# PART 4: OPERATIONAL CONTROL (Critical for Approval)

## 4.1 Global Village Controls Everything

**Nuqta guarantees:**

| Control | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Coin expiry** | 24 hours - non-negotiable |
| **Geographic lock** | Coins can't leave Global Village |
| **No cash withdrawal** | Zero leakage |
| **Full visibility** | Real-time dashboard for management |
| **Kill switch** | Can pause/cap/disable instantly |
| **Rule changes** | Global Village can adjust rules anytime |

**Key line to say:**
> "Global Village controls the rules. Nuqta just executes."

This sentence closes deals.

---

## 4.2 Risk Mitigation

| Risk | How We Handle |
|------|---------------|
| **Fraud** | Transaction limits, velocity checks, device fingerprinting |
| **Coin hoarding** | 24-hour expiry eliminates this |
| **Merchant abuse** | Transaction monitoring, audit trails |
| **Technical failure** | Offline mode, manual backup process |
| **Negative PR** | Clear T&Cs, customer support |

---

# PART 5: THE PITCH DECK (For Global Village Meeting)

## Slide 1: The Problem

> "Global Village visitors buy tickets but spend unpredictably inside.
> Merchants pay high stall fees but have no guaranteed footfall.
> You have no visibility into actual spending behavior."

## Slide 2: The Solution

> "Nuqta converts every ticket into guaranteed in-park spending."
>
> - Ticket = Global Village Coins
> - Coins expire in 24 hours
> - Only redeemable on AED 300+ purchases
> - Every transaction tracked in real-time

## Slide 3: How It Works

```
Visitor buys ticket (AED 30)
        ↓
Receives 30 Global Village Coins
        ↓
Shops at any store (QR payment)
        ↓
Spends AED 300+ → Unlocks coin redemption
        ↓
Earns MORE coins on every purchase
        ↓
Cycle continues until coins expire
```

## Slide 4: The Math

> "1M visitors × 40% redemption × AED 200 uplift = **AED 80M extra GMV**"

## Slide 5: What Global Village Gets

- Higher in-park GMV
- Happier merchants (bigger bills)
- Full spending analytics
- Zero operational burden
- Zero cost (funded by ticket value)

## Slide 6: What We Need

- Partnership agreement
- Access to onboard merchants
- Booth space at entrances
- Logo on event materials
- Integration with ticket system (optional)

## Slide 7: Pilot Proposal

> "Let's run a 2-weekend pilot.
> We onboard 50 merchants.
> You provide booth space.
> We measure GMV uplift.
> If it works, we scale to full season."

---

# PART 6: MEETING SCRIPT (60 Seconds)

**Opening (10 sec):**
> "Hi, I'm Rejaul from Nuqta. We help events convert ticket buyers into guaranteed shoppers."

**Problem (10 sec):**
> "Your visitors buy tickets but spend unpredictably. Your merchants pay high stall fees with no guaranteed customers."

**Solution (20 sec):**
> "With Nuqta, every ticket becomes Global Village Coins. Visitors get AED 30 in coins, but can only use them on purchases above AED 300. This guarantees higher spending."

**Proof (10 sec):**
> "Even 40% redemption means AED 80M extra GMV across the season. Zero cost to you."

**Ask (10 sec):**
> "Can we pilot this for 2 weekends with 50 merchants? If it works, we scale."

---

# PART 7: OBJECTION HANDLING

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have our own app" | "We're not replacing it. We add a spending layer on top. Users can use both." |
| "Our merchants won't agree" | "Merchants love it - bigger bills, more customers, no discounts required." |
| "What if visitors complain about coin expiry?" | "Clear T&Cs at signup. Plus, most people spend same-day anyway." |
| "This sounds complicated" | "For you, it's simple. We handle everything. You just approve the rules." |
| "We need board approval" | "Understood. Can we prepare a one-pager for the board with pilot results?" |
| "What's your track record?" | "We're new, which is why we propose a no-risk pilot first." |

---

# PART 8: EXPANSION - OTHER EVENTS

This model works for:

| Event Type | Example | Adaptation |
|------------|---------|------------|
| **Seasonal parks** | Global Village | 24-hour coins |
| **Expos** | Sharjah Expo, Gitex | Event-duration coins |
| **Food festivals** | Dubai Food Fest | Same-day coins |
| **Ramadan markets** | Night markets | Nightly expiry |
| **College fests** | University events | Event-day coins |
| **Corporate events** | Company family days | Event-only coins |
| **Pop-up markets** | Ripe, Last Exit | Weekend coins |

**The moat:**
> "Nobody owns the 'temporary city commerce OS' category. We do."
