CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Investor Meetings)
================================================================================

ISSUE #1: Phase Gates at 50% of Pitch Deck 🚨
├─ H2 Gate MAU: 5,000 → Should be 10,000
├─ H2 Gate Merchants: 125 → Should be 250
├─ H2 Gate GMV: AED 5M → Should be AED 10M
├─ H3 Gate MAU: 37,500 → Should be 75,000
└─ Phase 2 Gate MAU: 75,000 → Should be 150,000
Fix: 12 line changes (5 minutes)
Impact: Model advances to H2 prematurely without hitting deck targets

ISSUE #2: Revenue Streams Contradict Deck 🚨
├─ User Subscription: Enabled (5% attach) → Should be 0% in H1
├─ Finance Revenue: Enabled (15% attach) → Should be 0% in H1
└─ B2B Revenue: Enabled (5% GMV) → Should be 0% in H1
Fix: 3 line changes (2 minutes)
Impact: Deck says "zero user fees", model charges users

ISSUE #3: GMV Gap Not Explained 🚨
├─ Conservative Model: AED 2.95M
├─ Pitch Deck Target: AED 10M
└─ Gap: 3.4x (no explanation in UI)
Fix: Add alert box (10 minutes)
Impact: Looks like you'll miss targets by 70%

Total Fix Time: 25 minutes
Priority: HIGH - Do before showing to investors

================================================================================

INVESTOR READINESS
================================================================================

BEFORE FIXES:
❌ NOT READY - Will raise red flags
   Investor: "Your gates are 50% of deck - which is real?"
   Investor: "You charge user fees but deck says zero?"
   Investor: "GMV is 70% below target - why the huge gap?"

AFTER FIXES (25 minutes):
✅ INVESTOR-READY - Professional and consistent
   Investor: "Conservative model shows path to 10M - smart"
   Investor: "H1 focused on merchant fees only - disciplined"
   Investor: "Gates match deck perfectly - 10K/250/10M"
