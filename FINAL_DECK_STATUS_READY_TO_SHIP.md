## 📧 ELEVATOR PITCH (Memorize This)

**30-second version:**
> "We're Nuqta - the universal rewards card for the UAE. Think of us like Rakuten, but for offline spending. Shoppers earn 10% cashback everywhere they go - 5x better than credit cards. Merchants only pay when customers walk in - no upfront ad costs. We're raising $400K to acquire 500 merchants and 75K users, targeting a strategic exit in 48 months at 67-133x returns. We already have 30 signed LOIs."

**2-minute version:**
> "UAE residents waste AED 2.4 billion annually on loyalty programs - points expire, cards get lost, deals are impossible to find. Merchants waste AED 12 billion on Google ads and Instagram promos they can't track.
>
> Nuqta solves both. For users: one app, earn cashback everywhere, use it anywhere. For merchants: performance-based marketing - only pay 15% when customers actually show up, not for clicks that go nowhere.
>
> Our unit economics are exceptional - 10x LTV to CAC ratio, 92% gross margins. We project $150K revenue in Year 1, hitting break-even by Year 3, scaling to $38M by Year 5 with 60% EBITDA margins.
>
> We have clear exit paths. Careem, Noon, and Tabby all want what we're building - merchant networks with behavioral data. MENA exits prove this works: Careem sold for $3.1 billion at 14x revenue. At our projected Year 4 revenue of $12M, that's a $200-400M exit, translating to 67-133x returns for pre-seed investors.
>
> We're raising $400K to launch in Dubai with 500 merchants and 75K users. We already have 30 LOIs signed from cafes, salons, and gyms. Your $400K check could turn into $17-35 million in 4 years. Can I send you the deck?"

## 🎨 WHAT ABOUT TYPOGRAPHY?

**Should you fix it later?**
Maybe. Here's when:

### Fix Typography IF:
- ✅ You secure 2-3 investor meetings and have downtime between them
- ✅ An investor specifically comments on visual inconsistency (unlikely)
- ✅ You raise the $400K and want to polish deck for Series A

### DON'T Fix Typography IF:
- ❌ You're actively fundraising
- ❌ You have investor meetings scheduled
- ❌ You haven't sent the deck to at least 20 investors yet

**Reality Check:**
No investor has ever said "Great unit economics, strong traction, clear exit path... but I'm passing because your h2 headers use text-4xl instead of typography.h2."

Typography is a 1% detail. Fundraising is a 99% priority.

## 📞 QUESTIONS TO PREPARE FOR

Investors will ask these - practice your answers:

1. **"Why now?"** → Digital adoption post-COVID, Gen Z prefers instant rewards, UAE pushing cashless
2. **"What's your moat?"** → Network effects (both-sided marketplace), behavioral data no one else has
3. **"How do you acquire users?"** → Merchant QR codes (AED 10-15 CAC), campus ambassadors (AED 25-30 CAC)
4. **"Why won't Careem/Noon build this?"** → We have merchant relationships + 18-month head start. They'd rather acquire us.
5. **"What if merchants churn?"** → Weekly payouts + ROI dashboards + Brand Coins retention = <20% annual churn
6. **"How do you make money?"** → 5 revenue streams: transaction fees (7.5%), merchant subscriptions, data licensing, ads, Brand Coins
7. **"Who's on your team?"** → "I'm technical founder with [background]. Hiring VP Merchant Acquisition Month 2 with your $400K."
8. **"What are your biggest risks?"** → CAC inflation, merchant churn, regulatory changes - but we have mitigation for each
9. **"When's your next raise?"** → Series A in 18 months at $12-15M valuation after proving H1 metrics (250 merchants, 10K MAU)
10. **"Why should I invest?"** → 67-133x return potential in 48 months. Pre-seed is riskiest but highest ROI. We have 30 LOIs proving demand.

**You're ready. Go raise that $400K.**
