**Total Value: AED 80+ savings + Loyalty perks**

## IMPACT ON INVESTOR PERCEPTION

### Product Depth:
✅ Shows you're building something much deeper than competitors
✅ Partial payment/lock feature = reduces friction
✅ Flexible fulfillment = better UX than pure online
✅ Gamified perks = long-term engagement driver

### Moat Implications:
✅ More touchpoints = harder to replicate
✅ Visit-based unlocks = creates habit formation
✅ Dual rewards + perks = higher switching cost

### Revenue Implications:
✅ Lock/booking layer = transaction fees opportunity
✅ Offers section = promoted listings revenue
✅ Gamified perks = merchant spend on coins
