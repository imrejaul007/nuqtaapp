# 🏪 MERCHANT ONBOARDING STRATEGY - Complete Playbook

**Date:** January 31, 2026
**Purpose:** Answer investor question: "How will you onboard merchants?"
**Key Insight:** Merchants ARE the distribution channel. More merchants = more users.

---

## 🎯 THE CORE INSIGHT

### **Merchants Solve the Chicken-Egg Problem**

**Traditional marketplace:**
- ❌ Need users to get merchants
- ❌ Need merchants to get users
- ❌ Stuck in limbo, burn millions on paid ads

**Nuqta's approach:**
- ✅ **Merchants = distribution channel**
- ✅ Every merchant QR = free billboard
- ✅ 500 merchants × 40 customers/day = 20,000 daily impressions
- ✅ **Zero paid marketing needed**

---

## 📊 MERCHANT ONBOARDING FUNNEL

### **Year 1 Target: 500 Merchants**

| Month | Merchants Signed | Cumulative | Users Acquired | Method |
|-------|-----------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| **M1-2** | 20 | 20 | 1,000 | Founder sales (pilot) |
| **M3** | 30 | 50 | 3,000 | Event activation (Global Village) |
| **M4-6** | 50/month | 200 | 15,000 | Sales team (2 BDMs hired) |
| **M7-12** | 50/month | 500 | 50,000 | Self-serve + marketplace effects |

**Key Metric:** 1 merchant = 100 users (over 12 months)

---

## 🎯 MERCHANT ONBOARDING PLAYBOOK (Month-by-Month)

### **PHASE 1: Founder Sales (Month 1-2) - 20 Merchants**

**Target:** High-traffic, high-frequency categories
- F&B: Cafes with 100+ daily customers
- Salons: 30-50 appointments/day
- Gyms: 200+ members

**Approach: Personal Outreach**
```
Week 1-2: Dubai Marina & JBR
• Walk into 50 cafes/restaurants
• Ask for manager/owner
• 5-min pitch: "Zero upfront cost, bring new customers"
• Show demo app on phone
• Sign 10 merchants

Week 3-4: Downtown & Business Bay
• Target lunch spots (office workers)
• Gym chains (Fitness First, Gold's Gym)
• Salon chains (Tips & Toes, Nail Spa)
• Sign 10 merchants
```

**Pitch Script (30 seconds):**
> "Hi, I'm Rejaul from Nuqta. We bring you new customers for free.
>
> Here's how: You put our QR code at your counter. Your customers scan it, get 10% cashback in coins they can spend anywhere.
>
> You pay zero upfront. You only pay 15% when they redeem coins here later.
>
> Think of it like: You give AED 10 discount, but only 7 customers out of 10 come back. Net cost: AED 7 per customer vs AED 50 on Instagram ads.
>
> Can I show you a 2-minute demo?"

**Success Criteria:**
- 20 merchants signed
- 10 active (processing transactions)
- 1,000 users onboarded via QR
- Avg 50 users/merchant

---

### **PHASE 2: Event Activation (Month 3) - 30 Merchants**

**Target Event: Global Village (6M visitors, Oct-Apr)**

**Strategy:**
1. Partner with 30 food kiosks/stalls
2. Place Nuqta QR at checkout
3. Offer "Global Village Special": 15% cashback (vs usual 10%)
4. Staff 2 brand ambassadors to explain

**Merchant Pitch (Event-specific):**
> "Global Village has 6M visitors but only 10% are repeat.
>
> With Nuqta, every customer you serve becomes a repeat customer across all UAE.
>
> Example: Tourist visits your kiosk, earns 50 coins. Next week, they're in Dubai Mall - they can spend those coins at ANY Nuqta merchant. Your brand travels with them.
>
> Cost: Zero. You already give discounts to compete with other stalls. This makes YOUR discount redeemable everywhere = customer loyalty."

**Expected Results:**
- 30 merchants signed in 1 weekend
- 3,000 users acquired (5% of daily visitors scan QR)
- Proof: Event activations work

**Cost:**
- Event sponsorship: AED 15,000
- 2 ambassadors × AED 3,000 = AED 6,000
- **Total: AED 21,000 for 3,000 users = AED 7 CAC** 🔥

---

### **PHASE 3: Sales Team Scaling (Month 4-6) - 150 Merchants**

**Hire 2 Business Development Managers (BDMs)**

**BDM Profile:**
- Ex-Talabat/Deliveroo/Careem restaurant partnerships
- Arabic + English fluent
- UAE driving license
- Commission-driven (AED 200/merchant signed)

**BDM Targets:**
- 25 merchant meetings/week
- 10 sign-ups/month (40% close rate)
- 2 BDMs × 10 = 20 merchants/month

**Territory Split:**
- BDM 1: Dubai (Marina, JBR, Downtown, Business Bay)
- BDM 2: Abu Dhabi + Sharjah

**Sales Playbook:**

**Targeting:**
```
1. Scrape Google Maps for:
   - Restaurants with 4+ stars, 500+ reviews
   - Salons with 4+ stars, 200+ reviews
   - Gyms with 1,000+ Google searches/month

2. Build lead list (500 merchants)

3. Cold outreach:
   - WhatsApp message (UAE business standard)
   - "Hi [Name], I'm from Nuqta. We help [category] businesses get repeat customers. Can I show you a 5-min demo?"

4. Meeting flow:
   - Problem: "Customer acquisition costs are AED 50-100 on Instagram"
   - Solution: "We give you unlimited customers for AED 0 upfront"
   - Demo: Show merchant dashboard (real-time analytics)
   - Close: "Can we start with 1 QR code at checkout?"
```

**Objection Handling:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have a loyalty program" | "Great! Nuqta makes YOUR loyalty redeemable across 500 merchants. Your AED 10 discount now works at the gym, salon, anywhere." |
| "15% fee is too high" | "You only pay when customer REDEEMS. If they never come back, you pay zero. Compare that to Instagram: AED 100 upfront, no guarantee." |
| "How many users do you have?" | "We're at 5,000 now, adding 500/week. But here's the key: Every merchant you join brings 10 new customers via your QR. YOU control growth." |
| "I need to think about it" | "Totally understand. Can I leave you 1 QR code to test? Zero commitment. See if your customers like it. I'll check back in 2 weeks." |

**Expected Results (Month 4-6):**
- 50 merchants/month × 3 months = 150 merchants
- 150 merchants × 100 users = 15,000 users
- Proof: Sales team model works

**Cost:**
- 2 BDMs × AED 8,000/month = AED 48,000
- Commission: 150 merchants × AED 200 = AED 30,000
- **Total: AED 126,000 for 15,000 users = AED 8.4 CAC**

---

### **PHASE 4: Self-Serve Onboarding (Month 7-12) - 300 Merchants**

**Strategy: Merchant Marketplace Effects**

Once you hit 200 merchants + 15,000 users, merchants start COMING TO YOU:

**Triggers:**
1. **Peer pressure:** "Why does the cafe next door have a QR code and I don't?"
2. **Customer requests:** "Do you accept Nuqta?" (happens after 10K users)
3. **Revenue loss:** Merchant sees customers walking to competitors with Nuqta

**Self-Serve Funnel:**
```
1. Website: nuqtapp.com/merchants
   - "Join 200+ merchants giving 10% cashback"
   - "Sign up in 5 minutes"

2. Sign-up form:
   - Business name
   - Category (dropdown)
   - Location
   - Owner contact (WhatsApp)

3. Instant approval (for verified categories)
   - Get QR code immediately
   - Print & place at counter
   - Start earning customers

4. Onboarding call (optional)
   - BDM calls within 24 hours
   - "Welcome to Nuqta! Need help setting up?"
   - Upsell: Merchant campaigns, featured placement
```

**Merchant Referral Program:**
```
Give existing merchants incentive to recruit:
• Refer a merchant → Get AED 500 Nuqta credit
• Referred merchant gets 0% fee for first month

Target: 20% of merchants refer 1 new merchant
200 merchants × 20% = 40 referrals/month
```

**Expected Results (Month 7-12):**
- 50 merchants/month × 6 months = 300 merchants
- 300 merchants × 100 users = 30,000 users
- Proof: Network effects kick in

**Cost:**
- Merchant referral credits: 40/month × AED 500 × 6 = AED 120,000
- Self-serve platform: AED 30,000 (one-time)
- **Total: AED 150,000 for 30,000 users = AED 5 CAC** 🔥

```

## 🎯 MERCHANT VALUE PROPOSITION (30-Second Pitch)

### **For F&B Merchants:**
> "You're spending AED 5,000/month on Instagram ads. 50 people visit, 5 become regulars.
>
> With Nuqta: Zero upfront. Put a QR at your counter. 3,000 people see it. 60 scan. 45 sign up. 15 become regulars.
>
> You pay 15% only when they redeem. If they never come back, you pay nothing.
>
> Plus: Your discount works across 500 merchants. Customer earns coins at your cafe, spends at gym. Your brand travels with them."

---

### **For Salons/Gyms:**
> "Customer acquisition cost: AED 100-150 per customer.
>
> With Nuqta: You pay AED 0 upfront. Customer books appointment, earns 10% cashback (AED 20 on AED 200 service).
>
> They come back because they have AED 20 to spend. You pay AED 30 (15% of AED 200) when they redeem.
>
> Net cost: AED 30 vs AED 150 = You save AED 120 per customer."

---

### **For Retail:**
> "Loyalty programs cost AED 50,000-100,000 to build. You lock customers into YOUR store only.
>
> Nuqta: Zero cost. Your loyalty works across 500 merchants. Customer shops at you, earns coins, spends anywhere.
>
> Why does this help YOU? Because 499 other merchants are driving customers to their Nuqta app. When they open the app, they see YOU in 'Nearby Merchants.'
>
> You're piggybacking on 499 other merchants' marketing budgets."

---

## 🚀 WHY THIS SOLVES CHICKEN-EGG PROBLEM

### **Traditional Approach (FAILS):**
```
Step 1: Raise $5M
Step 2: Spend $2M on Instagram/Google ads
Step 3: Acquire 10K users
Step 4: Go to merchants: "We have 10K users, join us"
Step 5: Merchants: "Only 10K? Come back when you have 100K"
Step 6: Burn money for 2 years, run out of cash
```

---

### **Nuqta Approach (WORKS):**
```
Step 1: Raise $400K
Step 2: Founder signs 20 merchants (Month 1-2)
Step 3: Merchants place QR codes → Acquire 1,000 users (FREE)
Step 4: Go to next merchants: "We have 1,000 users + 20 merchants"
Step 5: Sign 30 more merchants (Month 3)
Step 6: Now have 50 merchants + 3,000 users
Step 7: Hire 2 BDMs (Month 4)
Step 8: BDMs sign 150 merchants → 15,000 users (Month 4-6)
Step 9: Hit tipping point: Merchants start calling YOU (Month 7+)
Step 10: Self-serve kicks in → 300 merchants → 50,000 users (Month 7-12)

Result: 500 merchants, 50K users, $400K spent, PROFITABLE.
```

**Key Difference:** Merchants ARE the marketing budget. Every merchant = 100 users FREE.

---

## 💡 INVESTOR PITCH (Updated)

### **Old Pitch (Weak on Merchant Strategy):**
> "We'll acquire users via QR codes and student ambassadors."

**Investor thinks:** "But how do you get merchants to put up QR codes?"

---

### **New Pitch (Strong on Merchant Strategy):**
> "We solve the chicken-egg problem by making merchants our distribution channel.
>
> Here's how: I personally sign the first 20 high-traffic cafes in Dubai Marina. Each cafe has 100 customers/day. I place a QR code at checkout. 2% scan it. That's 40 users/day from 20 merchants = 800 users/day = 24,000 users/month.
>
> Zero paid ads. Merchants become our billboards.
>
> Month 3: I activate Global Village (6M visitors). Sign 30 food kiosks. Acquire 3,000 users in 1 weekend.
>
> Month 4: Hire 2 BDMs with restaurant partnership experience. They sign 50 merchants/month = 5,000 users/month.
>
> Month 7: We hit 200 merchants + 15K users. Network effects kick in. Merchants start calling us: 'My competitor has Nuqta, I need it too.' Self-serve onboarding launches.
>
> Month 12: 500 merchants, 50K users, AED 50 blended CAC.
>
> The beauty: More merchants = more users. More users = easier to sign merchants. Classic flywheel.
>
> **Merchants ARE the solution to chicken-egg problem.**"

**Investor reaction:** "NOW I get it. You're not burning money on ads. Merchants are your free distribution. Smart."
