## 💡 KEY TALKING POINTS

### **Opening Hook (Slide 1):**
"We're building the smart shopping super-app for UAE. Think Careem meets Honey, with dual-loyalty rewards."

### **Problem (Slide 2):**
"UAE shoppers waste AED 2.4 billion annually in unclaimed rewards because existing tools are fragmented and post-purchase."

### **Solution (Slide 3):**
"Nuqta is the complete journey: discover offers, book with partial payment, get intelligent payment routing, earn double rewards, unlock perks."

### **Traction (Slide 5):**
"Here's what's different: We've already executed. 95% product ready, 30 signed merchant contracts, 6-person team assembled. Most pre-seed startups are idea-stage. We're execution-stage."

### **Unit Economics (Slide 8):**
"Our LTV to CAC ratio is 56.8 to 1. Industry benchmark is 3 to 1. We're 19x better than benchmark. We recover CAC in 18 days."

### **Go-to-Market (Slide 9):**
"We're not dependent on expensive paid ads. We have 10 acquisition channels with blended CAC of AED 18 to 22. College fests, student ambassadors, employee partnerships, co-branded packaging."

### **Moat (Slide 10):**
"Our POS lock-in gives us 12 to 18 months head start on Careem and Noon. We give merchants a free POS and inventory system. High switching cost. Plus 6 more compounding moats."

### **Team (Slide 11):**
"I'm a rare builder plus marketer founder. Ex-CTO who can build, growth marketer who can acquire, agency CEO with 50 UAE clients who already converted to 30 signed contracts."

### **Ask (Slide 12):**
"We're raising AED 1.85 million at AED 18.5 million pre. 60% goes to user acquisition, 25% team, 15% final product launch. We'll use this to hit 50,000 users in Year 1 and raise Series A."
