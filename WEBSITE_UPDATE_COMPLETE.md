### **4. Terms Page (/terms) - Investment Terms**

2. Addressable GMV: Avg AED 136K/month per merchant = AED 4.1M total
3. De-risked supply side: We have merchant supply, now we validate user demand

**Investor Implication Callout Box:**
"Most pre-seed startups have 0 signed commitments. 30 LOIs de-risks the biggest unknown: 'Will merchants participate?' Answer: Yes, they already committed."
